       " ['Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) has long been a stock market darling, but 2022 has been a rough year for the tech giant. Its share price is down 40% year to date, and it just became the first publicly traded company ever to lose $1 trillion in value, a reflection of just how far the company and its FAANG stock peers have fallen.\\n\\nWhile its recent performance has no doubt been frustrating for shareholders, there are still plenty of good reasons to buy Amazon today. Here are the top 10.\\n\\n1. The e-commerce business will bounce back\\n\\nE-commerce stocks were crushed this year, and Amazon was no exception. Through the first three quarters, the company\\'s e-commerce segments lost more than $8 billion, and management expects its growth slowdown to continue in the fourth quarter, forecasting revenue growth of just 2% to 8%.\\n\\nHowever, momentum in online retail will eventually return, and growth and profits will improve as well. The current slowdown largely reflects the pull-forward effect of the pandemic as online sales surged through much of 2020 and 2021. It\\'s not a permanent state.\\n\\n2. Amazon Web Services is still a rock star\\n\\nIt\\'s become a bit of a cliche to argue that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is worth as much as Amazon\\'s market cap, if not more. The numbers show why.\\n\\nThrough the first three quarters of 2022, revenue from the cloud infrastructure business jumped by 32% year over year to $58.7 billion, giving it an annual run rate of $75 billion, and its operating margin is now 30%. As a standalone entity, AWS would be one of the most profitable companies in the country.\\n\\nIt\\'s true that its growth has slowed a bit, coming in at 27% in the third quarter. That was due in part to macroeconomic headwinds as its customers have become more concerned about controlling their spending, but AWS is still growing rapidly, especially for a business of its size.\\n\\n3. The advertising business is booming\\n\\nWhile nearly every digital advertising platform posted weak growth in the third quarter, Amazon\\'s advertising revenues jumped by 30%. It\\'s now the No. 3 digital advertising platform in the U.S. behind Google and Facebook, and it\\'s on track to generate roughly $40 billion in revenue this year.\\n\\nIts strong growth in this weak macroeconomic climate is a testament to the sticky nature of the business as third-party sellers depend on Amazon ads to sell their goods, and there\\'s no other platform like it for them to go to.\\n\\n4. It has the greatest customer loyalty program ever\\n\\nAmazon Prime now has more than 200 million members around the world, and it\\'s a big reason why Amazon\\'s e-commerce business has been so successful.\\n\\nPrime incentivizes spending on Amazon and blocks out competitors by leveraging its logistics network to provide free two-day shipping. The company continues to invest in Prime benefits, adding Thursday Night Football to its streaming video offerings, as it sees Prime as a key strategy for driving e-commerce growth.\\n\\n5. It\\'s about to get more profitable\\n\\nAmazon\\'s profits have lagged, and the company has long prioritized investing in long-term growth over making short-term profits. However, as the company matures, management seems to be recognizing that some costs have spun out of control, and that even a company that prizes experimentation can do too much of it.\\n\\nIn the last few months, Amazon has shut down Amazon Care, its telehealth and in-person healthcare business, and Scout, its delivery robot. And reports just came out that management plans to lay off 10,000 corporate workers in divisions including Alexa and other devices, retail, and human resources. That should help give the bottom line a boost.\\n\\n6. Bezos is still in the building\\n\\nJeff Bezos no longer runs the company on a day-to-day basis. He passed those duties off last year to CEO Andy Jassy, who previously ran AWS.\\n\\nHowever, Bezos is still the executive chairman and the largest shareholder, and Jassy regularly seeks his counsel. You can bet that any major decision at the company is going to include his input.\\n\\n7. The economy will rebound\\n\\nAmazon isn\\'t a recession-proof company. Its e-commerce business is primarily built on sales of discretionary products, and cloud infrastructure and advertising are both sensitive to the business cycle as well.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s weak recent results and guidance stem in part from a set of macroeconomic challenges that will eventually dissipate. Additionally, the headwinds it faces internationally from the stronger dollar will fade, giving its revenue growth a boost.\\n\\n8. The stock is well priced\\n\\nIt might be hard to call Amazon cheap based on its current valuation metrics, but the stock is well-priced, down around 50% from a year ago.\\n\\nFundamentally, the company isn\\'t much different from what it was a year ago, though its growth has slowed and its profitability has waned. However, any number of catalysts could help restore growth and profitability, including the ones discussed above.\\n\\nOnce market sentiment shifts, Amazon should rebound rapidly.\\n\\n9. Its competitive advantages are clear\\n\\nAmazon is so powerful that the mere hint that it may enter another industry is often enough to send potential peer stocks spiraling. This year, for example, Shopify stock fell sharply, in part because of the threat from Amazon\\'s new Buy with Prime program, which allows independent websites to sell products with Prime shipping.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s competitive advantages -- including Prime, its third-party marketplace, Fulfillment by Amazon, its vast warehouse network, and its reputation for customer satisfaction -- allow it to muscle into new industries. Those attributes also help explain why Amazon still dominates U.S. e-commerce with a market share of about 40%. Considering that it now faces competition from brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Costco, and Target, as well as tech platforms like Shopify, its ability to maintain that huge market share is no small feat.\\n\\n10. More experiments are coming\\n\\nThere are still plenty of ideas in Amazon\\'s pipeline that could yield big returns. Take Amazon Go, for instance. The company\\'s \"Just Walk Out\" technology allows shoppers to buy products at Amazon\\'s convenience stores without ever stopping at a checkout counter to pay for them. That\\'s a level of convenience unmatched by conventional retailers.\\n\\nThe company has begun adding the \"Just Walk Out\" technology to Amazon Fresh supermarkets and even some Whole Foods locations, and that\\'s just one example of how the company is inventing on behalf of the customer.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s commitment to invention and experimentation is central to its corporate culture, and that, along with its prowess in businesses like e-commerce and cloud computing, will drive its success in the future.',\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nShares of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) were down more than the markets today, declining 2.9% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT.\\n\\nWhile the broader tech indexes were down as investors appeared to be trimming gains from the recent run-up in stocks, Amazon fell more, perhaps due to a negative Wall Street Journal article on the e-commerce giant regarding some recent customer satisfaction surveys.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nOn Monday, the Wall Street Journal published an article on its home page whose thesis is that customer satisfaction at Amazon\\'s e-commerce unit might be waning. Right ahead of the holidays, that\\'s not a great headline, certainly for a company that preaches \"customer obsession.\"\\n\\nThe article cited three broad customer satisfaction surveys.\\n\\nFirst, Evercore ISI held its regular survey of Amazon customers, revealing that the proportion of customers that considered themselves \"extremely\" or \"very satisfied\" with Amazon came in at \"just\" 79%. While that\\'s higher than in the depths of the pandemic, when there were widespread delays, it is down from the peak rate of 88% from one decade ago.\\n\\nheld its regular survey of Amazon customers, revealing that the proportion of customers that considered themselves \"extremely\" or \"very satisfied\" with Amazon came in at \"just\" 79%. While that\\'s higher than in the depths of the pandemic, when there were widespread delays, it is down from the peak rate of 88% from one decade ago. Furthermore, a different survey from the American Customer Satisfaction Index gave Amazon a score of 78 out of 100, its worst performance since 2000.\\n\\nFinally, consulting firm Brooks Bell also conducted a study of 1,000 Amazon customers, finding that roughly one-third reported late deliveries or products of low quality.\\n\\nThe findings are certainly concerning, since the general step-down in satisfaction is showing up in three different surveys. Of course, the effects of the pandemic are still being felt in terms of labor shortages and other factors. Furthermore, competing e-commerce sites don\\'t have nearly the volume that Amazon does, nor do they make the promises Amazon does, such as the recent push for one-day shipping. Amazon has kept ratcheting up its promises, giving it a higher bar to clear.\\n\\nStill, there might be real problems here. The increase in third-party sellers on the platform could be causing some issues with product quality. Also, the ramp-up in advertising on the website could complicate customer searches if results are overloaded with ads from irrelevant or lower-tier brands. And the automation of customer service could be frustrating to people who wish to easily speak with a human being.\\n\\nAmazon likely can\\'t afford to pull back on those elements, because third-party sales have grown at a higher pace than first-party items, and advertising revenues have been one of the bright spots in Amazon\\'s earnings results over the past few quarters, even as e-commerce has struggled more broadly. The e-commerce unit has also dipped back into losses, so investing heavily in more in-person customer service would also increase costs.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nThe recent survey results aren\\'t a reason for long-term Amazon investors to panic even though the stock is down more than the market today. The WSJ notes that Amazon spent $1 billion last year combating counterfeiters, fraud, fake reviews, and other bad actors on the platform. Just a couple weeks ago, Amazon\\'s Counterfeit Crimes Unit helped identify and disrupt three major counterfeit networks in China, where 240,000 fake items were seized by authorities. Commenting on the WSJ article, an Amazon spokesperson also noted high ratings for its mobile app.\\n\\nAmazon also has a history of tackling problems head-on and doing the difficult work to overcome them, which is why it\\'s enjoyed such long-term success. However, investors should keep a watch on these customer surveys as well as announcements from Amazon and its management team about how they are going to improve on these issues.\\n\\nAfter a brutal year for tech stocks and with a potential recession looming, Amazon\\'s valuation on a price-to-sales basis is now the lowest it\\'s been since early 2015, just before it broke out the results from Amazon Web Services. As long as Amazon isn\\'t in terminal decline -- and I don\\'t think it is -- shares are looking like quite the deal these days for long-term-oriented investors.',\n",
       "  \"Increasing inflation has stunted consumer spending in 2022, leading many stocks to suffer from a stock market sell-off. The Nasdaq Composite index has fallen 29% since January as investors fear for the short-term prospects of companies across multiple industries.\\n\\nWalt Disney (DIS -1.40%) and Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) have each suffered at the hands of macroeconomic headwinds, with their stocks falling between 40% to 44% year to date. However, as these companies are responsible for a significant market share in their respective industries, the decline in their share prices might signal that it's an excellent time to buy.\\n\\nAfter all, it's always best to invest in a company's long-term outlook rather than the short-term risks of a potential recession that might or might not occur. So which one is the better buy, Disney or Amazon? Let's find out.\\n\\nDisney\\n\\nAs a titan of the entertainment industry, Disney has had a rough few years. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in theme park and movie theater closures that took a massive bite out of the company's revenue. However, reopenings have made 2022 a transitionary year for Disney as it works to maximize profits at its parks and grow its streaming business.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter of 2022 brought concern for its media and entertainment segment, which saw revenue fall 3% year over year to $12.7 billion and operating income plunge 91% to $83 million. The segment encompasses all of Disney's earnings from its streaming, film, and TV businesses. It primarily suffered from the company's $30 billion content spend throughout 2022 to grow Disney+.\\n\\nDisney's investment in the platform may seem excessive. It has spooked investors, who sent Disney shares falling 7% after its Q4 2022 results were posted. But the company has seen returns in the form of subscribers. Disney reached a total of 235.7 million streaming subscribers in its latest quarter, beating Netflix's 223 million.\\n\\nDisney has had to make a hefty investment in streaming to achieve its current dominating position, with Disney+ accumulating 164.2 million members in three years. Comparatively, Netflix took 12 years to reach the same figure after launching in 2007. With the $372 billion streaming industry expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 19.9% until at least 2029, according to Fortune Business Insights, Disney could be in prime position to see major gains in the long term.\\n\\nAdditionally, in its Q4 2022 report, Disney revealed that it expects Disney+ to reach profitability in 2024. Along with monetizing former complimentary services like Fast Pass in its theme parks to raise its revenue per visitor, Disney could be the king of streaming and home to a thriving parks business in a few years.\\n\\nAmazon\\n\\nAs a titan of e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon has enjoyed years of dominance in two immensely lucrative industries. However, declines in consumer spending throughout 2022 have hit the company hard, which was evidenced in its latest quarterly report.\\n\\nIn Q3 2022, Amazon reported revenue of $127.1 billion against analysts' expectations of $127.46 billion. The company's projections for its fourth-quarter earnings also did little to ease investor worries. The company anticipates between $140 billion and $148 billion, while analysts at Refinitiv expected $155.15 billion for the next quarter.\\n\\nWhile declines in revenue may not be so surprising in the current economic climate, the most concerning part of the quarter came from the company's cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services. The segment saw revenue rise 27.4% year over year to $20.5 billion against Wall Street forecasts of $21.1 billion. The revenue miss signals slowing growth for the segment as revenue increased by 33% in Q2 2022 and by 39% in Q3 2021.\\n\\nWith its 37.8% market share in e-commerce and a majority 34% share in cloud computing, Amazon will likely come back strong over the long term. However, with slowing revenue in Amazon Web Services -- its fastest-growing segment -- and the likelihood of continued declines in its e-commerce business thanks to a potential recession, Amazon may be a risky investment for now.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio still stands at 86 despite steep declines in its stock price, and the company suffered $4.97 billion in negative cash flow in the latest quarter. By contrast, Disney shares trade at a P/E of 53, and the company produced free cash flow of $1.37 billion.\\n\\nDisney had a rough quarter, but its excellent long-term prospects in streaming and excess cash to make it through a potential recession make it a more attractive investment than Amazon today.\",\n",
       "  \"Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.Com Inc., speaks during the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Washington, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021.\\n\\nAmazon has exited the trillion-dollar club.\\n\\nShares of the e-retailer plunged 5.9% on Tuesday, falling for a fifth straight day and closing at their lowest since April 2020. The sell-off has erased almost all of the stock's pandemic surge.\\n\\nInvestors continued to punish the company for last week's disappointing fourth-quarter forecast. Amazon said revenue during the holiday quarter would grow 2% to 8% over the year-ago period, far below analysts' estimates. The cloud division, Amazon Web Services, also reported weaker-than-expected sales.\\n\\nIt's the first time Amazon's market cap has been below $1 trillion since April 2020. The stock has plunged 42% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008, when it dropped 45%. The only other year that was worse was during the dot-com crash of 2000, when the company lost 80% of its value.\\n\\nLike the rest of Big Tech, Amazon has struggled this year due to a slumping economy, soaring inflation and rising interest rates. On top of that, Amazon has been forced to scale back after expanding dramatically during the pandemic, now that consumers have returned to stores.\\n\\nAmazon has been the second-worst performer in the Big Tech group this year, behind Facebook parent Meta, which has plummeted 72%. Meta told investors last week that revenue in the fourth quarter would likely decline for a third straight period.\\n\\n-- CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this report.\\n\\nWATCH: Amazon did not deliver on earnings\",\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) surged 12% on Thursday, following an encouraging inflation report and news of more cost cuts designed to bolster the online retail giant's profitability.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nThe Consumer Price Index -- a closely watched measure of inflation -- rose 0.4% in October and 7.7% year over year. That was down from highs near 9% earlier in the year and better than Wall Street and many economists feared.\\n\\nThe news gave hope to investors that the Federal Reserve would soon be able to dial back its interest rate increases, potentially staving off a recession. The stock markets, in turn, rallied, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rising a whopping 5.5% and 7.4%, respectively.\\n\\nThe positive inflation news also bodes well for Amazon. Higher costs for food, energy, shelter, and many other goods and services have forced many consumers to reduce their discretionary spending. That's taken a major toll on Amazon's online retail operations. Meanwhile, recession fears have driven many businesses to cut spending on technology and marketing, which has weighed on the growth of Amazon's cloud computing and adverting businesses. If these trends begin to reverse, the e-commerce titan's growth could reaccelerate.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nYet Amazon isn't just waiting for the tide to turn. CEO Andy Jassy is reportedly overseeing a large-scale cost-cutting review to rightsize the company's expenses and pare back unprofitable projects, according to The Wall Street Journal.\\n\\nThe Journal's report was encouraging to investors concerned about Amazon's sagging profitability in recent quarters. Steeper cost cuts could not just stem losses, but also allow Amazon to harvest more profits from its colossal e-commerce and cloud computing operations when the economy eventually strengthens.\",\n",
       "  'Higher inflation has been weighing on Amazon\\'s (AMZN 0.80%) e-commerce business for about a year. But the company\\'s other big business -- cloud computing services -- has defied the pressure, continuing to grow both revenue and operating income.\\n\\nIn Amazon\\'s third-quarter earnings report this week, though, Amazon Web Services (AWS) showed that it isn\\'t immune to the current economic troubles. AWS still grew at a double-digit percentage rate, but its growth fell short of analysts\\' expectations. As a result, the stock slid 7% in Thursday\\'s trading session, and lost another 6.8% from there on Friday. That brought this year\\'s decline to about 38%. Does this latest AWS news suggest that it\\'s time to give up on Amazon -- or is this troubled stock a bad news buy?\\n\\nThe importance of AWS\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s talk about the role AWS plays in Amazon\\'s earnings picture. It\\'s a pretty important one. In recent years, AWS has driven the bulk of Amazon\\'s profits. In 2021, it accounted for 74% of Amazon\\'s total operating income. Cloud services are, by nature, a much higher-margin business than e-commerce. Amazon\\'s overall operating margin stood at 4.4% a year ago, while AWS had an operating margin of about 30%.\\n\\nCloud computing services also are something many companies can neither do without nor manage on their own. But consumers can and do put the brakes on their spending and limit what they buy on Amazon when times are tough.\\n\\nIn the third quarter, though, AWS clients started cutting back, which resulted in the segment missing analysts\\' revenue forecasts: AWS reported a 27% gain in sales, while the analyst consensus had been for an increase of 31%. That was also a slowdown from the 33% year-over-year gain in Q2.\\n\\nIt\\'s possible this sales slowdown will be more than just a one-quarter phenomenon. Inflationary pressures and general economic troubles aren\\'t over. And it may take some time for AWS customers to return to their usual financial situations. Management even said during the earnings call that the growth percentage rate for AWS actually was in the mid-20s toward the end of the quarter -- and the company is applying that to the fourth quarter.\\n\\nThat said, AWS has what it takes to handle the challenge. The company says it\\'s helping its customers turn what are usually thought of as fixed expenses into variable expenses. Amazon has the tools available to help customers lower their cloud computing services costs when necessary -- and still stick with AWS, no matter what the economic environment. Clients can choose lower-priced options like scalable cloud services powered by Amazon\\'s own Graviton processors, for example.\\n\\nIs it time to buy?\\n\\nSo is Amazon a bad news buy? First, it\\'s important to note that this week\\'s news wasn\\'t all that bad. Sure, we would have preferred to see growth accelerating in Amazon Web Services. But, considering the current economic situation, it\\'s not surprising that there was a bit of a slowdown.\\n\\nThere are two bits of good news, though. First, as mentioned, the breadth of AWS\\' offerings allows it to adjust to customers\\' needs during difficult times. Second, these difficult times are temporary. Once the economy improves, AWS\\' growth is likely to take off once again.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s consider Amazon\\'s valuation. The company is trading for about 2 times sales -- its lowest valuation by that metric in about six years. That looks like a bargain price, particularly for people taking a long-term approach to investing in the company. AWS\\' future is promising. It\\'s the leader in an industry that\\'s forecast to grow rapidly. According to a report from Precedence Research, the size of the cloud computing market is set to increase at a compound annual rate of more than 17% through the end of this decade.\\n\\nIn the world of e-commerce, Amazon also is a leader. And according to research firm Statista, global retail e-commerce is set to grow by a total of 56% between 2021 and 2026. In short, today\\'s e-commerce pains are likely to be temporary too.\\n\\nAll of this means that Amazon is absolutely a buy today. But let\\'s forget about the \"bad news\" part -- because the news isn\\'t as bad if we look at the company through a long-term lens.',\n",
       "  'Amazon shares plunged 7% on Friday, a day after the company projected sales in the holiday quarter would be far below expectations.\\n\\nAmazon shares pared back some losses from earlier Friday morning, when the stock was off about 50% from its highs, resulting in about a $940.8 billion hit to Amazon\\'s value. Earlier in the day, the stock traded at its lowest since April 2020.\\n\\nThe company said Thursday that revenue would be between $140 billion and $148 billion in the three-month period ending the year, which was far below consensus estimates of $155.15 billion, according to Refinitiv.\\n\\nRevenue in the third quarter came in at $127.1 billion, up 15% year over year but slightly softer than Wall Street\\'s expected $127.46 billion. Amazon\\'s cloud business reported a 27.5% revenue growth rate for the quarter, which is the slowest growth since 2014, when the company began breaking out AWS results.\\n\\nThe results capped off a rocky earnings week for Big Tech, where Amazon, Alphabet , Meta and Microsoft all missed expectations for parts of their businesses, signaling how record inflation, rising interest rates and fears of a recession are roiling their businesses. Several companies issued bleak forecasts, indicating more trouble could lie ahead.\\n\\nSome analysts on Friday shaved their price targets for Amazon\\'s stock to reflect near-term concerns. Still, others said they remain confident in the retail giant\\'s long-term prospects.\\n\\n\"Overall, while all of AMZN\\'s business units are likely exposed to broader macro pressures, we do not view 3Q results or 4Q guidance as thesis changing,\" wrote JMP Securities\\' Nicholas Jones, who maintained his market outperform rating on Amazon shares but revised his price target down to $140 from $150.\\n\\n\"AMZN\\'s solutions within retail and cloud remain compelling offerings, in our opinion, and advertising continues to have a large opportunity for growth beyond promoted listings,\" Jones wrote. \"Accordingly, we see AMZN as a best-in-class internet business that can not only weather the macro storm, but emerge primed to reaccelerate growth.\"\\n\\nWolfe Research analyst Deepak Mathivanan wrote in a note that Amazon\\'s fourth-quarter guidance shows it\\'s not immune to the challenging global macro environment.\\n\\n\"However, we think the company is well positioned to navigate a choppy demand environment with minimal disruption to operations and potentially gain share from sub-scale players,\" said Mathivanan, who kept his outperform rating on Amazon shares but trimmed his price target to $130 from $150.\\n\\nWATCH: Amazon misses on revenue, stock plummets on weak fourth-quarter guidance',\n",
       "  'Amazon (AMZN) received several mentions Tuesday from Wall Street analysts covering a range of topics. The cautiously optimistic commentary about the initiatives management is taking to cut costs and bring investments to a level more in line with revenue dynamics and the slowing global economy increases our conviction that margin pressure should begin to abate. Still down about 40% year to date, Amazon shares have gained about 15% since last Thursday\\'s surge higher along with the broader market. The stock had been on the skids since reporting just an OK quarter and weak guidance after the closing bell on Oct. 27. However, with signs that Amazon is about to address its bloated cost structure, which was something sorely missing from last month\\'s release, we hope the stock can continue on the road to recovery. Morgan Stanley\\'s take Morgan Stanley reiterated Amazon as a top pick, noting that the online retail and cloud giant, along with Alphabet (GOOGL), are their preferred ways to play the mega-cap space with overweight (buy) ratings. However, analysts there remain cautious on Meta Platforms (META), with an equal-weight (hold), due to \"higher structural question marks about META\\'s moats\" and current capital expenditure spending. While including commentary on Alphabet and Meta from the note as a point of reference, we\\'re mostly focusing on Amazon. Despite their relatively bullish outlook on Amazon, they remain cautious due to elevated inflation, high costs, weakening consumer balance sheets and economic headwinds. These concerns caused them to \"modestly reduce\" estimates on Amazon, as well as Alphabet and Meta. Morgan Stanley left Amazon\\'s price target at $140 per share, which represents about 40% upside from Monday\\'s close. The analysts are now modeling 5% growth in U.S. ecommerce in 2023, down from 10% previously. The analysts cut Alphabet and Meta\\'s price targets. GOOGL\\'s went to $120 per share from $125, room for a roughly 25% gain. Meta\\'s went to $100 from $105, about 12% below Monday\\'s close. From a top-down view, Morgan Stanley maintained that Amazon remains \"strategically positioned\" to take market share in e-commerce and enterprise spend \"through/post downturn.\" From a bottom-up view, the analysts acknowledged that Amazon, along with other large-cap tech names, is finally taking its medicine. In Amazon\\'s case, this refers to a broad cost-cutting review , and according to The New York Times, plans to lay off roughly 10,000 employees as soon as this week. Based on midpoint estimated salary ranges, the job cuts could reduce costs by about $2.75 billion. A lot of money to be sure, but remember that relatively speaking, that\\'s only about a 1% reduction of Amazon\\'s global workforce of 1.54 million people. Earlier this month, Amazon expanded its hiring freeze to its entire corporate workforce. MoffettNathanson\\'s take MoffettNathanson updated investors on their view of the broader e-commerce landscape, saying they prefer market-share gainers like Amazon \"as the algorithm of the internet creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for continued share loss once it starts.\" Of course, that implies that share gainers will continue to gain. Before digging in, the analysts there said they \"do not subscribe to the bear case of peak e-commerce penetration\" because online shopping is more convenient and often cheaper than shopping in-store, not to mention is more transparent given that comparing prices across websites is inherently easier than traveling from one physical store to the next. Speaking on share losers, the analysts called out Covid as a \"double-edged sword\" as the pure-play names such as Wayfair and Chewy came out of it in a competitively worse position because the pandemic forced the legacy brick-and-mortar players they were taking business from to accelerate investments in e-commerce infrastructure. Amazon, of course, is far from a pure-play, offering what may be the broadest inventory selection of any retailer in the world, be they online or physical. On its note, MoffettNathanson said that if an online retailer is going to sell commodity products, they need fulfillment scale and speed, two areas where Amazon has overinvested in recent years — and, as a result, is now in a position to grow into that capacity. In reviewing what makes a great marketplace, the analysts highlighted Etsy , taking a favorable view of the online platform for handmade items\\' success in aggregating a highly fragmented global market of 7.5 million artisans and creators under one umbrella. However, they called out Amazon\\'s business model as the gold standard due to Prime memberships driving customer loyalty and recurring purchases while keeping retention costs low. Moreover, because Amazon\\'s direct traffic rates are best in class, they have some of the lowest ad spend of all their peers. That direct traffic has also allowed the company to build out an advertising business that generates nearly $40 billion annually — $9.5 billion alone in the third quarter. Looking forward, MoffettNathanson said, \"profit beats and declining capital intensity are the formula for multiple expansion. For three years, Amazon has experienced multiple compression as EBIT [earnings before interest and taxes] estimates declined and capital intensity was greater than expected. We believe we are at the end of the tunnel.\" Barclays\\' take Barclays believes Amazon provides a favorable risk/reward at current levels as retail operating margins improve in 2023 and Amazon Web Services stabilizes. Regarding AWS, recall that customers have been pulling back on the cloud in an effort to better align costs with their own customer demand. After all, the most attractive thing about moving to the cloud is that it converts fixed costs to variable ones. However, the focus of the Barclays note was on Amazon\\'s India business, with analysts calling out that both Amazon and Walmart -owned Flipkart were both growing their toplines in the low-30% range as of March 2022 and around 20% to 25% heading into 2023. A solid rate of growth to be sure, however, even better, they believe the pace of operating losses is improving. Amazon India is 4.4% of international retail revenue and 23% of international operating income losses, according to Barclays. Even more encouraging than what\\'s going on in retail, they also noted that \"AWS growth in India has been accelerating nicely\" off a low base. Keep in mind that the profit margin profile of AWS is leaps and bounds ahead of retail. As of March, AWS India was generating $1.2 billion in sales growing at 65% annually on a foreign exchange-neutral basis, the fastest rate since 2019. Remember, India is the second-most populated country in the world — just behind China and well ahead of the United States. The Club\\'s take Taking all of these updates as a whole, Amazon remains something of a \"show me\" story following its most recent quarterly results. While we wished we sold shares at a higher level, hindsight is 20/20 — and at this point, we think fundamentals are set to improve going forward. As noted in our earnings analysis last month, we believe that management is prepared to make the tough choices needed to lean out the operation — and as profit margins are cleaned up on the back of cost-cutting initiatives, free cash flow should significantly improve. That, in turn, should lead to a higher stock price. While we think current levels offer an attractive risk/reward for longer-term investors due to improving fundamentals, more patience will be required. At the moment, we prefer names where the spending is already more aligned with the operating environment and where the macroeconomic backdrop is more supportive. Moreover, we tend not to like chasing large moves such as what we\\'ve recently, a view consistent with our decision to trim shares of Microsoft (MSFT) earlier this week.

       "  \"Bear markets are awful.\\n\\nUnless, of course, you view them as an opportunity to scoop up shares of incredible businesses at wild discounts. We've all thought it: I wish I had bought stock X at crazy price $Y when the market was punishing it in year Z. Well, 2022 may very well be your chance to make good on that wish.\\n\\nThree Fool.com contributors think new Warren Buffett stock Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 3.26%), e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN 0.80%), and top semiconductor technologist ASML Holding (ASML 2.74%) are buys during this bear market. Here's why.\\n\\nIt's not too late to buy Warren Buffett's latest stock pick\\n\\nBilly Duberstein (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): While Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, got a nice 10% boost on the news Warren Buffett took a big stake in the world's largest chipmaker, the stock is still down 50% from its all-time high and still trades for less than 15 times earnings.\\n\\nThat's not too shabby for a company that demonstrates the ability to pass on higher prices to its customers, even if those customers are as powerful as Apple and Nvidia. When confronted with rising materials and freight costs this year, TSMC was able to pass on price increases with no customer refusing, according to Taiwan's Economic Daily News.\\n\\nThis is because TSMC dominates the semiconductor manufacturing industry, producing more than 50% of all semiconductors globally, while also leading the production of the most advanced semiconductors made on the latest node.\\n\\nWhile both Intel and Samsung are investing heavily in their foundry businesses, with the goal of catching up to TSMC's technology lead, it's far from assured these companies will be able to -- especially as TSMC invests another $36 billion this year in capital expenditures. By comparison, Intel just lowered its 2022 capex plans to $21 billion, amid its own business challenges this year.\\n\\nLeading-edge semiconductor production is only becoming more and more difficult, as the distance between transistors shrinks to a matter of angstroms. Thus, it may prove difficult for TSMC's peers to catch up -- especially as TSMC is in a stronger position financially as well as technologically.\\n\\nOn its recent conference call, TSMC management said that while the semiconductor industry will likely shrink in 2023 amid a global downturn, TSMC will still grow, due to its competitive advantages:\\n\\nWe expect probably 2023, the semiconductor industry will likely decline. But TSMC also is not immune, but we believe our technology position, strong portfolio in HPC [high-performance computing] and longer-term strategic relationship with customer will enable our business to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry. And that's why we say in 2023, still a growth year for TSMC, and the overall industry probably will decline.\\n\\nA company that can pass along price increases to customers and grow even when its overall industry is declining is no doubt quite attractive -- especially when the stock trades for such a reasonable valuation. No wonder Buffett likes the stock.\\n\\nWhy Amazon is a screaming buy today\\n\\nAnders Bylund (Amazon): E-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon is in the dumps right now. The stock has lost more than $1 trillion in market value from the all-time peak in the summer of 2021. The run-up that started with the COVID-19 lockdowns in the spring of 2020 is just a memory now. Amazon share prices are back where they were at the start of 2020, missing out on a dividend-adjusted 27% gain for the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nThe prevailing Amazon thesis today is that online shopping has peaked and there's nowhere to go but down. The company seemed to support that idea when it announced layoffs just ahead of the holidays. The stock sold off further as a result.\\n\\nI think that's a huge mistake. Amazon bears are missing out on a massive moneymaking opportunity here.\\n\\nYou can't stop the retail market from moving online over time. Sure, there will always be a niche market for brick-and-mortar stores where shoppers can touch and smell the goods. However, most people will eventually prefer the lower costs found on online shopping portals with automated warehouses and ultra-low overhead costs. This revolution is only getting started, as e-commerce sales account for less than 15% of the total retail market today.\\n\\nSo Amazon is pumping the brakes on operating costs for this holiday season, in the middle of an inflation-powered economic crisis. But the stormy seas must eventually subside, and Amazon's business growth should hit the ground running again whenever that happens. Meanwhile, I'm excited to see Amazon's stock price going nowhere in three years while annual sales have increased by 80%.\\n\\nIn short, the rumors of Amazon's death are exaggerated. This giant isn't going away, and the company's best days are still far in the future. Conventional wisdom tells investors to buy low and sell high, and the best time to follow that advice is when there's blood on the Street. This bear market has made Amazon a screaming buy for long-term investors.\\n\\nASML: 30% more expected growth, but 30% less in price\\n\\nNicholas Rossolillo (ASML Holding): If you were looking for a green flag before investing in ASML Holding, management just waved one better -- a purple-ish flag. The Dutch company, which has a monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography equipment used in making the most advanced chips around, just provided quite the update to its 2025 financial targets.\\n\\nAt the company's investor day a year ago, it predicted it would generate revenue in between $24 billion and $30 billion by 2025. But things have changed. Semiconductor demand is through the roof and only headed higher as chips proliferate in all sorts of consumer devices, industrial equipment, and data centers. The U.S. CHIPS Act and other government programs from other countries are helping boost chip manufacturing. As a result, ASML now thinks its revenue can reach a range of $30 billion to $40 billion by 2025. That's a 30% increase from the outlook last year, at the midpoint of guidance.\\n\\nFor reference, ASML revenue was just over $21 billion in the last 12-month stretch. Assuming it only reaches the low end of its guidance -- $30 billion -- in the next three years, that still represents a compound annual growth rate of 11%. Not bad, ASML.\\n\\nBear in mind that ASML's position as a critical chipmaking equipment supplier (and the only one with irreplaceable EUV technology, no less) means it will remain highly profitable. It pays a rising dividend and returns a generous amount of its remaining free cash flow back to shareholders via stock repurchases. Management just boosted that buyback authorization by another $12 billion.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, ASML stock rebounded in a dramatic fashion. However, as of this writing, the stock still remains down over 30% from where it was one year ago. With a lot of reasons to feel even more optimistic about this company's prospects than before, now still looks like an incredible time to buy and hold for the next few years.\",\n",
       "  'Amazon\\'s (AMZN 0.80%) big news so far this week was the announcement on Monday that the company plans to lay off 10,000 workers. However, the e-commerce and cloud-hosting giant followed up with an even more surprising development.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, the company introduced its new virtual care service, Amazon Clinic, which \"connects customers with affordable virtual care options when and how they need it.\" Is Amazon stock a buy after the unveiling of this new healthcare service?\\n\\nThe second time\\'s the charm?\\n\\nIf this story sounds really familiar, it should. Amazon launched another virtual care service called Amazon Care in 2019. However, the company is shutting that service down by the end of this year.\\n\\nHow does Amazon Clinic differ from Amazon Care? For one thing, it\\'s much more limited in scope. Amazon Clinic will provide virtual care only for about 20 common conditions. These include acne, allergies, migraines, and urinary tract infections.\\n\\nAmazon Care was available nationwide. Amazon Clinic, though, will at least initially be available in only 32 states. Amazon Care also offered in-person healthcare services in many cities, while Amazon Clinic will provide only virtual care services.\\n\\nWith Amazon Clinic, customers will be able to choose from a list of licensed telehealth providers. However, they\\'ll have to pay for the services out of pocket. Amazon Clinic won\\'t accept insurance, at least for now.\\n\\nPotential impact\\n\\nAmazon\\'s shares jumped nearly 4% in early trading on Tuesday. Were investors celebrating that Amazon will once again join the ranks of telehealth stocks? Maybe a little. However, the main reason for Amazon\\'s surge was that all the major market indexes rose after October wholesale prices increased less than expected.\\n\\nThe reality is that the impact of Amazon Clinic on the company\\'s overall business will almost certainly be quite small. Amazon generated revenue of $127.1 billion in the third quarter. It would take a lot of virtual care visits to even amount to chump change in comparison to that massive sales total.\\n\\nSure, Amazon Pharmacy could receive a boost from prescriptions stemming from Amazon Clinic. But customers will be able to choose other pharmacies as well. The increased volume for Amazon Pharmacy probably won\\'t be large, especially in the early innings for Amazon Clinic.\\n\\nAmazon did say that its healthcare services will be eligible for flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs). However, not accepting insurance will almost certainly get in the way of Amazon Clinic making a big impact on the company financially.\\n\\nTwo different questions\\n\\nIs Amazon stock a buy because of its new healthcare service? No. The impact of Amazon Clinic probably won\\'t be great enough to influence investors\\' buying decisions. However, whether Amazon stock is a buy at all is a different question. I think that the answer to this second question is a resounding yes.\\n\\nAmazon still has significant growth opportunities. The latest indication that inflation could be moderating should be great news for the company. Lower inflation would benefit Amazon\\'s e-commerce business as well as its Amazon Web Services cloud hosting unit.\\n\\nThe stock has fallen the most from its peak since the Great Recession. History shows that when Amazon experiences a steep decline, it roars back.\\n\\nAmazon Clinic could eventually be a huge success. But even if it isn\\'t, the virtual care service highlights Amazon\\'s ability to expand into new markets. Sometimes the company will win with these moves and sometimes it won\\'t. However, stocks with as many potential ways to generate growth as Amazon tend to perform really well over the long term.',\n",
       "  'Even amid worry that the U.S. is facing a recession that will hit retailers, Amazon remains JPMorgan\\'s best idea ahead of its third quarter earnings results, due Thursday. Since its last earnings report, Amazon stock has shed roughly 28%, and JPMorgan has trimmed its estimates to account for currency headwinds given the strong U.S. dollar and slower discretionary spending. Still, the firm is bullish on Amazon — it has an overweight rating and a $175 price target on the company. \"We remain confident AMZN can re-accelerate revenue growth and expand OI margins into 2023, largely driven by Retail improvement and still solid AWS growth,\" wrote Doug Anmuth in a Wednesday note. He acknowledged that Amazon may be impacted by some of the same forces that hit Alphabet and Microsoft in their respective quarters. Microsoft reported an earnings beat but shares fell on a weak guidance, while Alphabet missed Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines. \"MSFT Azure growth slowdown in the December quarter could also be reflected at AWS, but we still expect Cloud spend to be resilient given secular shift & prioritization for corporates,\" he said. \"GOOGL\\'s results last night may also raise concerns about heavy spending & headcount, but we believe AMZN is a couple quarters ahead in rightsizing its cost structure post pandemic & therefore closer to benefiting from margin improvement.\" The big picture Amazon is better positioned than its peers to withstand an economic downturn due to its low prices, shipping speed and inventory, according to Anmuth. \"Retail top line concern is mostly driven by macro & how AMZN will hold up in a recessionary environment,\" he said. \"Near-term, we think higher in-stock levels and faster delivery speeds will be key drivers as Prime returns to normal, & we expect AMZN to have an inventory advantage this holiday season as omni-channel retailers may be more constrained by physical space, while AMZN also has the benefit of 3P sellers.\" The company should also benefit from lower freight and fuel costs relative to the first half of the year, as well as further rationalization of heavy pandemic spending. In addition, the company focus on improving its retail margins will help overall. The company has a goal of returning retail margin levels to what they saw before the coronavirus pandemic. \"At Code last month, CEO Andy Jassy indicated that AMZN built out the logistics network in a couple years when it was expected to take 6-10 years,\" Anmuth said. \"He also called Retail a mid-single digit margin business, which we think reflects more of a target margin.\" Elsewhere, Anmuth is encouraged by the cloud service AWS\\'s $100 billion backlog and sees solid growth for the sector going forward. The company is also boosting its free cash flow to return to pre-pandemic levels. — CNBC\\'s Michael Bloom contributed to this report.',\n",
       "  \"Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) has operated outside of North America for nearly 25 years, but the company is still losing tons of money abroad.\\n\\nIts international segment, which is primarily made up of e-commerce sales outside of North America, has lost $5.5 billion through the first three quarters of 2022, and has been in the red for much of its history.\\n\\nAt a time when Amazon stock seems to be in freefall, it's easy to place the blame on the international business and the other unprofitable businesses like it. The company has long prized growth above profitability, and founder Jeff Bezos instilled a culture of managing the business for the long term, placing relatively little value on short-term profits.\\n\\nHowever, there's more to the international business than meets the eye. Although the segment is losing money, it's not as if Amazon is failing in every country it operates in. In fact, there's an opportunity for the company to significantly boost its profitability by streamlining its business in international markets, and the market seems to be ignoring it.\\n\\nA mix of markets\\n\\nAmazon operates local sites in over a dozen countries, but some international markets are much more mature than others.\\n\\nFor example, it has operated in the U.K. since 1998, but it just launched a local site in Belgium in the third quarter. On the earnings call, CFO Brian Olsavsky explained why the company is losing so much money this year in the international segment:\\n\\n[I]nternational is always a mix of profitability in more established countries of Europe and Japan, offset by emerging countries and investments in Prime benefits. I think the biggest issue quarter over quarter, [is that] the increase in losses versus Q2 was tied to some additional operating costs in Europe. We've seen higher fuel costs there, even more certainly in the United States.\\n\\nHe also said that Prime Day sales tend to lead to losses, as the company sells a lot of devices for the shopping holiday, which it generally sells at cost to then create a profit stream through selling content on those devices.\\n\\nBut it's worth taking stock of Olsavsky's statement. Amazon isn't profitable because it's incapable of turning a profit abroad. Instead, the company continues to invest in growth by adding Prime benefits in these countries and pouring billions into emerging markets like India, which Bezos sees as a generational bet.\\n\\nIs it time for restraint?\\n\\nAlthough Amazon has more control over its international business than it might seem, that doesn't change the fact that it has still lost more than $5 billion from the segment this year, and much more than that over its history.\\n\\nWith overall revenue growth slowing to single digits and its core e-commerce businesses losing money in both the North America and International segments, Amazon is tightening its belt like never before. The company has paused hiring in divisions, including corporate retail and Amazon Web Services. It's also pulling the plug on experiments like Amazon Care, its telehealth and in-person healthcare initiative, and Scout, its delivery robot.\\n\\nWith the international segment burning $2.5 billion in the most recent quarter, it may be time for some belt tightening abroad as well.\\n\\nAmazon has built a huge business outside of North America, with revenue on track to top $100 billion this year, but it's not worth much if it can't turn a profit there. Whether its investments in countries like Belgium and India will pay off still remains to be seen.\\n\\nIt may not be so easy for Amazon to flip the profitability lever in the international sector, as it's not going to pull out of the markets it's already operating in. But finding a way to improve the bottom line in the international segment would go a long way toward improving the company's overall financial picture.\\n\\nThe good news is the company is in the middle of a cost-cutting review that's likely to slash at least some expenses in international markets, which seems ripe for such an opportunity. With Amazon already losing over $5 billion in that segment this year, cutting billions in expenses could send the stock soaring, especially as it's down 50% from its peak last year.\\n\\nWith that in mind, investors would be wise to buy the stock now before the impact of those moves shows up on the bottom line.\",\n",
       "  'Amazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) is making a big mistake -- and no, I\\'m not talking about its plan to lay off 10,000 workers, announced earlier this week.\\n\\nAs my fellow Fool Jeremy Bowman explained on Monday, CEO Andy Jassy\\'s plan to right-size Amazon\\'s workforce holds the potential to save the internet retailer as much as $1 billion a year in salaries -- which is great. Unfortunately, $1 billion is peanuts in light of the potential $10 billion in cash that Amazon wants to throw into an ill-considered effort to compete with SpaceX in satellite internet.\\n\\nSpaceX is the company to beat\\n\\nSpaceX didn\\'t invent the idea of transmitting broadband internet from space. Other companies like Hughes, Viasat, and Iridium were doing satellite-based internet long before SpaceX came on the scene. But SpaceX has inarguably made the biggest splash in this business, launching more than 3,500 Starlink satellites into orbit over the past two years (of which approximately 92% remain in service today).\\n\\nOver time, as SpaceX launches more and more Starlink satellites into orbit (12,000, or even 42,000, are planned) and signs up more and more customers for Starlink (the total market size in the U.S. alone could be as high as 60 million customers), SpaceX sees Starlink growing into a $30 billion business.\\n\\nIt\\'s no surprise that numbers like these have attracted Amazon\\'s interest. The problem is that the time to begin racing SpaceX to capture this market was two years ago when Starlink was just getting off the ground. Two years later, Amazon\\'s attempt to horn in on the business that SpaceX has built just looks sad.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s slow start\\n\\nAccording to documents filed with the Federal Communications Commission, Amazon aims to launch 3,236 KuiperSats into orbit. Amazon has enlisted an army of rocket launch companies to help it with this project -- everyone from Boeing and Lockheed Martin to Airbus, Blue Origin, and start-up space firm ABL.\\n\\nAnd yet, Amazon hasn\\'t yet begun launching KuiperSats with anyone -- and the clock is ticking. In order to meet the conditions of its FCC license, Amazon must put half its 3,236 satellites (so 1,618) into orbit by the end of 2026. Current plans are for the first two satellites to go up aboard the inaugural United Launch Alliance (ULA) Vulcan Centaur flight, scheduled for early next year.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s high hopes\\n\\nEven assuming that the launch goes off as planned, though, Amazon must launch 1,616 KuiperSats over the next four years, which is quite a tall order.\\n\\nConsider: Each KuiperSat is believed to mass about 500 kilograms and will be launching to an orbit of 500 to 600 kilometers distant. A ULA Vulcan rocket with two solid rocket boosters should be able to lift about 15,000 kilograms of payload to that orbit, such that ULA (for example) could put about 30 Kuiper satellites, per flight, into orbit for Amazon. This implies that Amazon will need 54 launches in four years.\\n\\nTo put that in context, though, over the last four years, all the launches that ULA managed to conduct for all its customers amounted to just 24 launches. So it\\'s a very real question whether Amazon has enough time to meet its license requirements with the FCC.\\n\\nDepending on the kindness of strangers\\n\\nAmazon may have a solution to this problem, but it\\'s a bit off-the-wall. While ULA is averaging only six launches per year, SpaceX has conducted more than 50 launches so far in 2022 alone. Last month, Amazon Senior VP for Devices and Services Dave Limp suggested Amazon might consider hiring rockets from SpaceX to help it meet its goal.\\n\\n\"Yes, we are open to talking to SpaceX. You\\'d be crazy not to, given their track record [of rapid launches],\" said Limp, calling SpaceX\\'s Falcon Heavy rocket, and its upcoming Starship rocket, in particular, \"very viable candidates.\"\\n\\nBut here\\'s the problem with that plan: When SpaceX uses Falcon rockets to put Starlink satellites into orbit, it\\'s paying itself for launch services, so it can later charge relatively less for Starlink access once the satellites are in orbit. If Amazon uses SpaceX rockets to put KuiperSats in orbit, however, it will be subsidizing its competition with every dollar it pays -- and SpaceX can charge less for Starlink service while Amazon will have to charge more for KuiperSat service!\\n\\nIt\\'s hard to imagine how this ends well for Amazon.

       "  'What happened\\n\\nAlphabet (GOOGL 1.52%) (GOOG 1.57%), the world leader in online advertising, released its third-quarter financial report after the market closed Tuesday, and the results were disappointing. Furthermore, these results were seen as a harbinger of what\\'s to come for the rest of the digital advertising industry.\\n\\nAs a result, many adtech and digital advertising stocks fell in sympathy on Wednesday, as investors considered what was to come. Shares of The Trade Desk (TTD 0.12%) and Meta Platforms (META 1.44%) slumped as much as 8.1% and 5.5%, respectively, while Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) and Roku (ROKU 1.30%) had fallen as much as 4.8% and 3.9% respectively. As of 1:59 p.m. ET, the quartet was down 3.9%, 5.1%, 3.9%, and 2.9%, respectively.\\n\\nThis sell-off was broad based, taking down a wide variety of companies that rely on digital advertising for their livelihood. Earlier this year, Google\\'s ad revenue seemed largely immune to the recessionary fears that gripped much of Wall Street. It\\'s well documented that advertising is among the first items in corporate budgets to be slashed in times of economic uncertainty, and it seems that reality has finally caught up with the digital advertising kingpin.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nIn the third quarter, Alphabet reported revenue of $69.1 billion, which grew just 6% year over year. Foreign currency headwinds played a part, as revenue would have been up 11% in constant currency. For context, revenue in the prior-year quarter grew by 41%.\\n\\nThe pressure on the top line also dented profits, as earnings per share (EPS) of $1.06 declined 24%. Analysts\\' consensus estimates had called for revenue of $71 billion and EPS of $1.26, so Alphabet failed to clear either bar.\\n\\nHowever, commentary by the company sent investors running for the exits, as management detailed several factors that will weigh on results for the coming quarter. Alphabet cited tough comps, worsening foreign exchange headwinds, and lower ad spending as companies shore up their financial positions in the face of growing economic uncertainty.\\n\\nAs a result of the disappointing results, analysts issued a flurry of price target reductions, with no fewer than 14 of Wall Street\\'s finest cutting their expectations. JMP Securities analyst Andrew Boone seemed to capture the prevailing mood, saying the results were a warning sign that digital advertising this quarter will likely be weaker than originally imagined.\\n\\nBernstein analyst Mark Shmulik echoed those sentiments, writing, \"Google is an ad business first, and digital ads [are] no longer a safe place to hide.\"\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAlphabet\\'s results seemed to suggest the writing is on the wall for the rest of the digital advertising and adtech space. That said, investors shouldn\\'t be too quick to jump ship but rather assess the potential for each of these companies on their own merit.\\n\\nMeta Platforms leads the social media space and is widely regarded as the other company in the Google/Facebook duopoly that dominates much of the digital advertising space. Given the similarities in their business models and Meta\\'s reliance on digital advertising for more than 97% of its revenue and all of its profits, the comparison is an appropriate one. After that, however, the contrasts become more pronounced.\\n\\nAmazon derives the lion\\'s share of its revenue from e-commerce and cloud computing, though in recent years, digital advertising has been one of the company\\'s fastest-growing businesses. Amazon\\'s advertising services revenue grew 20% so far this year but still represents just 7% of the company\\'s total revenue, so the sell-off in this case is likely related to the state of the broader economy and the potential to slow growth in its e-commerce and cloud segments.\\n\\nRoku is an interesting one. Investors inexorably link the company with its namesake streaming devices, but many are unaware that Roku derives the majority of its revenue from the digital advertising that appears on its streaming video platform. Alphabet said that digital ads on YouTube, the company\\'s streaming platform, declined 2% year over year, the first such decline since Alphabet began reporting the platform\\'s results in 2019. This could spell trouble for Roku in the coming quarters.\\n\\nFinally, there\\'s The Trade Desk. The company\\'s adtech platform places digital ads across a wide spectrum of online locations, acting as a go-between for some of the world\\'s largest ad agencies.\\n\\nWhen The Trade Desk released its second-quarter report in early August, the results were surprisingly robust. Revenue grew 35% year over year, while adjusted EPS climbed 11%. At the time, CEO Jeff Green made a startling pronouncement, saying (emphasis mine), \"This trend also gives us confidence that we will continue to gain market share in any market environment.\"\\n\\nThe Trade Desk is seen as a striking alternative to advertising in the walled gardens offered by Google, Facebook, and Amazon. It also has one of the highest valuations, a function of its consistently strong results and entrenched position in the industry. While the stock may yet feel the impact of the economic downturn, The Trade Desk is still my top pick among these digital advertising and adtech stocks.',\n",
       "  \"Even after accounting for last week's rally, it's been a historically bad year for Wall Street. Not only did the benchmark S&P 500 produce its worst first-half return since 1970, but according to Charlie Bilello, the founder and CEO of Compound Capital Advisors, the S&P 500 has already endured its greatest number of 1% (or greater) down days since 2008.\\n\\nDespite this demoralizing short-term move in the major U.S. indexes, investors have still found a source of inspiration in this market. I'm talking about stock splits.\\n\\nA stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its outstanding share count and share price without having any impact on its daily operations or its market cap. Well over 200 stock splits have been announced and enacted since the year began.\\n\\nStock splits come in two varieties: forward splits and reverse splits. Reverse splits are designed to increase a company's share price while lowering its outstanding share count by the same magnitude. While not always a sign of weakness, reverse splits are typically enacted to avoid delisting from a major U.S. exchange.\\n\\nMeanwhile, forward stock splits lower a publicly traded company's share price while increasing its outstanding share count by the same factor. Most investors flock to forward stock-split stocks as it almost always signals a company that's firing on all cylinders and out-innovating its peers.\\n\\nWhile there have been a number of high-profile forward stock splits in 2022, two stocks stand head-and-shoulders above their peers as incredible values. The following two stock-split stocks have the competitive advantages and innovative capacity needed to double your money by 2026.\\n\\nAmazon\\n\\nThe first stock-split stock that has the ability to double your money over the next four years is e-commerce stock Amazon (AMZN 0.80%). Amazon completed a 20-for-1 stock split in early June.\\n\\nLike most growth stocks, Amazon and its peers have been taken to the woodshed during the current bear market. Interest rates are rising rapidly, which is cutting off access to the cheap capital fast-paced companies had been using to hire, expand, and innovate.\\n\\nMore specific to Amazon, it's encountering weakness from its online marketplace as high inflation bites the pocketbooks of low-earning consumers. To add, companies trading at premium valuations are often hit hardest during double-digit percentage declines in the major U.S. stock indexes.\\n\\nAlthough it's been a rough year, none of these headwinds is particularly worrisome. The most important thing for investors to understand is that even though Amazon generates most of its revenue from its dominant e-commerce platform, this segment generates only a small percentage of its operating cash flow and income. The company's marketplace has acted as a fantastic lure that's opened up bountiful high-margin sales channels.\\n\\nAs an example, Amazon's thoroughly dominant online marketplace was the catalyst that helped it sign up more than 200 million people worldwide to a Prime membership, as of April 2021. This figure has almost assuredly risen given Amazon's exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football. This high-margin, recurring-revenue-driven segment is nearly pacing $36 billion in annual run-rate revenue.\\n\\nAdditionally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's No. 1 cloud infrastructure service provider, with the segment accounting for close to a third of all cloud spending during the second quarter. AWS is pacing more than $82 billion in yearly run-rate sales, and its superior margins have made it responsible for most of Amazon's operating income.\\n\\nEven advertising services are playing a key role for Amazon. Despite challenging economic conditions, Amazon's advertising services grew by 30% on a constant-currency basis from the prior-year period in the third quarter.\\n\\nCollectively, subscription services, advertising services, and AWS, are growing by a sustained double-digit percentage on a constant-currency basis, and are responsible for most of Amazon's current and future cash flow growth.\\n\\nBetween 2010 and 2019, Amazon ended each year valued at 23 to 37 times cash flow. Based on Wall Street's cash flow forecast, you can buy shares today for just 6.6 times the company's expected cash flow in 2026. That's bargain-basement cheap and all the more reason Amazon can double in four years.\\n\\nAlphabet\\n\\nThe second stock-split stock that has an excellent chance to double your money by 2026 is Alphabet (GOOGL 1.52%) (GOOG 1.57%), the parent of internet search engine Google and streaming platform YouTube. Alphabet enacted a 20-for-1 stock split following shareholder approval in mid-July.\\n\\nLike its FAANG stock brethren, Alphabet has fallen off a proverbial cliff in recent months. With fear mounting that a U.S. recession could be around the corner, advertisers have pared back their spending. That's not good news for a company like Alphabet that relies so heavily on ad revenue.\\n\\nIncluding adverse currency movements during the third quarter (i.e., a stronger U.S. dollar), Alphabet's year-over-year ad revenue from YouTube declined. The other point of concern was the wider loss by Google Cloud despite 38% year-over-year sales growth.\\n\\nWhile these headwinds shouldn't be swept under the rug or ignored, it's important to recognize that they're short-term in nature. For instance, ad-driven businesses benefit from a simple numbers game. Even though recessions will always be an inevitable part of the economic cycle, history shows that recessions are much shorter events than periods of economic expansion. This is a fancy way of saying that Alphabet's ad operations spend a disproportionate amount of time benefiting from U.S. and global economic expansion than it does under the grey skies of a recession.\\n\\nTo build on this point, Google enjoys phenomenal success as the most-dominant internet search engine in the world. For more than two years, Google has accounted for between 91% and 93% of global search each and every month. Advertisers are well aware of this, which is why they're willing to pay a premium to get their message in front of users. This borderline monopoly for Google isn't going away anytime soon, and it's providing Alphabet with plenty of cash flow to reinvest in other areas.\\n\\nOne of Alphabet's ancillary growth channels is the aforementioned YouTube, which has become the second most-visited social site on the planet. Alphabet has been tinkering with YouTube Shorts as a means to monetize viewers without having to rely on longer videos to do so.\\n\\nThere's also Google Cloud, which as noted is losing money at the moment. Whereas AWS holds a 31% share of global cloud spending, Google Cloud is the world's No. 3 infrastructure service provider with an 8% share, according to a report by Canalys. With sustained annual sales growth in Cloud of nearly 40%, the expectation would be for operating cash flow in this segment to pick up big-time by mid-decade.\\n\\nAnd don't overlook Alphabet's balance sheet, either. As of Sept. 30, 2022, the company was sitting on $116.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to $14.7 billion in debt. A cash-rich balance sheet gives Alphabet the financial flexibility to invest in high-growth initiatives and make acquisitions.\\n\\nOver the past five years, Alphabet has averaged a multiple of 18.9 times its cash flow. But if Wall Street's 2026 cash flow estimate for Alphabet proves accurate, you can buy shares right now for a multiple of 6.6 times cash flow (yes, the exact same multiple as Amazon by 2026). That would be historically cheap for such a fast-growing company like Alphabet.\",\n",
       "  \"We'd all love to have Warren Buffett's investing track record -- increasing the value of our stocks by an annual average of about 20% over more than 50 years. You're probably not going to achieve quite that, but there are still ways you can invest kind of like the super-investor.\\n\\nFor starters, you might buy shares of his company, Berkshire Hathaway. It's not likely to grow quite as rapidly in the future as it has in the past, though, due to its massive size. Another option is to invest in some of the same companies that Berkshire Hathaway has invested in.\\n\\nHere are three of the conglomerate's major stock holdings. Note that it's not necessarily Buffett himself who has decided to buy them, as he has two investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who also call many shots.\\n\\n1. Apple\\n\\nBuffett long avoided tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL 1.47%), and he has said that the Apple buy was not his idea. He's certainly pleased with it, though -- as it's estimated that his cost basis in the stock is around $37.17 per share, and shares were recently trading around $150 apiece. Indeed, Berkshire recently owned nearly 5.5% of Apple -- which translates to a stake worth around $134 billion of a company recently worth $2.4 trillion!\\n\\nShould you invest in Apple? It's hard to argue against the growth stock. All signs point to the company sticking around for a long time and continuing to innovate, as it does so well. It's enormous, but it can still grow at a respectable clip. In its fourth quarter, Apple posted revenue up 8% year over year to $90 billion, and up 8% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022. It doesn't seem too overvalued at recent levels, either, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.7, close to its five-year average of 24.1.\\n\\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM 3.26%) is a newcomer to the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, and since semiconductors are not one of the industries that Buffett knows best, this is likely another purchase by his carefully handpicked lieutenants. According to the latest report, it's already the 10th largest holding (Apple is by far the biggest), with a total value recently near $5 billion, representing about 1.16% of the company.\\n\\nThere are many semiconductor companies out there, but Taiwan Semiconductor is one of the few that actually manufactures them, instead of just designing them -- and it's the world's largest contract chipmaker. That has helped give it fat -- and generally increasing -- profit margins. In its second quarter, revenue surged 43.5% year over year, while net income and earnings per share soared 76%.\\n\\nShares were recently down 43% from their 52-week high and appear quite attractively priced, with a recent P/E ratio of 14.9, well below the five-year average of 23.5. Do remember that the company is cyclical -- and Taiwan-based, so it does carry some risks from its neighbor China.\\n\\n3. Amazon\\n\\nAmazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) is also a Berkshire Hathaway holding -- though not a huge one, at around 1% of Amazon. That's still a big stake, worth around $1 billion recently. It's easy to see why Buffett, or one or both of his lieutenants, would like Amazon. Not only does it have the dominant e-commerce destination, it has other valuable assets, such as its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business. AWS also dominates in market share -- though it faces powerful competition.\\n\\nThe company's third-quarter report disappointed many investors, with a slowing growth rate due in part to inflation and rising interest rates. But the growth rates were only slowing to approximately pre-pandemic rates, and revenue still grew 15% year over year -- not too shabby for a company with a recent market value of $980 billion. Its long-term growth potential remains.\\n\\nAmazon's shares were recently down 50% from their 52-week high, and appear attractively priced, with a recent forward-looking P/E ratio of 47, well below the five-year average of 75.\\n\\nThese are just a few of Buffett's and Berkshire's many stock holdings that you might consider for berths in your own portfolio. Each or all of them might help set you up for life, if they perform up to their potential.\",\n",

I said, ‘No, grandpa, I want to run the Opry.”\\n\\nMTK, who is now head of country music at Amazon Music, clarified that she didn’t necessarily mean she wanted to work at the Opry—the world-famous country music venue in Nashville, Tennessee—rather, she wanted to be a part of the country music industry.\\n\\n“This music brought me and my grandpa so much joy, and I was passionate about sharing it with as many people as possible,” she said.\\n\\nPhoto by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson\\n\\nHer love of all things country—and words from an early mentor to “follow the music”—have led MTK through the close-knit country music industry to her current role developing the country genre for Amazon Music. She is now responsible for helping millions of fans connect with the music they love through fun experiences like livestreams, award shows, and merch campaigns.\\n\\n“I knew what I wanted from a very young age, and I'm so lucky I get to live out that dream here at Amazon Music,” she said.\\n\\nWe met with MTK to learn more about her career and how she got to where she is today. Keep reading to hear about her career highlights, her hilarious moments with country icons, and how she’s innovating at Amazon.\\n\\nPhoto by Lucas Jackson\\n\\nMeeting her heroes\\n\\nAfter nearly two decades working at major talent agencies and record labels, we knew MTK would have some stories about meeting country music’s biggest stars. What we didn’t expect was how much we would laugh when she told us the story of how she met one of her heroes.\\n\\n“Reba McEntire is the biggest of the big for me. She’s from Oklahoma and I’m from Kansas,” MTK explained, “So for me, she’s always represented that you could leave your small town and live out your country dreams. I was so excited when I got the chance to meet her early in my career at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).”\\n\\nMcEntire was signed with CAA at the time, and the team had the chance to meet her after a listening session.\\n\\n“This was my moment—this was the queen of country music and I was finally going to meet her,” she said. “Reba was going down the line introducing herself to everyone, and I was getting more and more nervous and excited as she got closer to me. I was practicing what I was going to say in my head. Finally, she gets to me and says, ‘Hi, I'm Reba. Nice to meet you.' And I go, 'Hi, I'm Stephanie. Wait, that's not my name.' And I looked down at the ground, walked out of the room, got in the elevator, got in my car, and drove away, crying on the way home.”\\n\\nEight years passed before MTK found the right opportunity to redeem herself. She’d been in the same room as McEntire at many events since the initial meeting, but it took a nudge from her boss at Big Machine Records to find the nerve to reintroduce herself.\\n\\n“I was working in the press room at the Country Music Awards when my boss walked in with a look on his face that told me he was up to something,” she said. “There had been rumors that Reba was going to be there, and all of the sudden I get a tap on the shoulder and I turn around and Reba goes, ‘Hi, I'm Reba. I hear you have a story to tell me.'”\\n\\nFortunately, McEntire found the situation as hilarious as we did.\\n\\n“She was rolling laughing and said, ‘Well, let's make this official. Shall we? Hi, I'm Reba. Nice to meet you.' And I said, 'Hi, I'm Michelle,’” MTK laughed. “She's magical and wonderful and smells like rainbows and sunshine. That's what I will say about Reba McEntire.”\\n\\nPlaying a part in country music history\\n\\nIn the years since, MTK has become accustomed to working alongside major artists, and her excitement for helping fans discover new artists has only grown stronger. Over the course of her career, she’s played a part in launching hit songs and developing big acts, like Lady A and Florida Georgia Line.\\n\\n“What's so great about the music community is many of us are close friends who work together and have actual relationships,” she said. “I was part of discovering and developing Lady A early on in my career at CAA, and we've stayed close as they took off—they were even at my wedding.”\\n\\n“I also had the honor of surprising Florida Georgia Line with a No. 1 plaque onstage at their sold-out concert at Fenway Park. The song was ‘God, Your Momma, and Me’ with the Backstreet Boys and they were on tour together, so I had the opportunity to be a part of the presentation. It's a gift to share such special moments with artists.”\\n\\nHelping artists achieve their dreams is rewarding on its own, and MTK said it really comes full circle when fans connect with the music she’s worked on.\\n\\n“Sometimes I’m in the supermarket and I hear someone singing along to a song that I worked on, and I feel so proud,” she said. “I go back to that little girl who fell in love with country music and feel so grateful to play even a small role in helping fans connect with the stories country music has to tell.”\\n\\nInnovating at Amazon Music\\n\\nSince joining Amazon in 2021, MTK has led a talented team on a mission to connect more fans with the music and artists they love—and they’re off to an incredible start. Together with the head of country programming Emily Cohen Belote, whom MTK calls “Golden Ears,” the Country Heat brand on Amazon Music has reached more than 5 billion streams with its “Country Heat” playlist and podcast over the last year alone. The team has also boosted the service's offerings to customers by embracing up-and-coming country stars like Bailey Zimmerman and BRELAND, and artists on the cusp of superstardom like Lainey Wilson.\\n\\n“Being the head of country at Amazon Music is so special, because we get to engage artists and share their music on a global scale,” MTK said. “We get to tell artists’ stories and connect with fans in new ways using Amazon’s broad range of services.”\\n\\nPhoto by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson Photo by Lucas Jackson\\n\\nIn her first year with Amazon Music, MTK had the opportunity to work with teams across the company to help produce the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards show.\\n\\n“Prime Video stepped up to broadcast the ACM Awards this year, and the country music team supported as they worked to put it all together in record time,” she said. “The timing was tight, and it was incredible to see how many people across Amazon—from Fashion to Prime Video, Music, and Twitch—came together so quickly to move a mountain. The fact that the entire effort was driven by a passion for music made it even more amazing. We also got to work with the incredible Dolly Parton, which was a huge plus.”\\n\\nThis was the first fully streamed music awards show, and the streaming format made it easier than ever for customers to watch the show from their devices. Her team has also developed livestreams through Prime Video, Twitch, and the Amazon Music app to give fans access to historically exclusive events, like album launch parties and intimate shows.\\n\\n“It’s exciting to be able to help artists reach a significantly bigger audience when they’re launching new music, while also helping millions of fans access new experiences through streaming,” she said.\\n\\nIt’s a lot of work to grow an entire genre for Amazon Music, but this stage of building something into its full potential is exactly the type of challenge that MTK loves. As she continues to build on her storied career in the country music industry, the sky is the limit for what MTK and her team will deliver for Amazon Music customers next.\\n\\n“Little Michelle would be so proud if she could see how far we’ve come,” she said. “I used to watch shows like the ACMs on TV and listen to my favorite artists on the radio, and now I work in my dream job making it easier than ever for fans to fall in love with country music.”\\n\\nGo behind the scenes with MTK\",\n",
       "  \"High inflation has hit the stock market like a wrecking ball this year. The S&P 500 delivered its worst first-half performance in five decades, and the broad-based index has dipped into bear market territory. But many individual stocks have slipped even further as investor sentiment has soured.\\n\\nFor instance, Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) and Shopify (SHOP 0.20%) have seen their share prices plunge 45% and 80%, respectively. Amazon has never lost that much value at any point in the past decade, and Shopify has never lost much that value in its history. Of course, things may get worse in the near term, but this is still a perfect buying opportunity for investors.\\n\\nHere's why.\\n\\nAmazon: The most-visited online marketplace in the world\\n\\nMacroeconomic headwinds continued to plague Amazon in the third quarter. Revenue growth of 15% missed estimates, net income dropped 9%, and fourth-quarter guidance fell short of Wall Street's forecast.\\n\\nThose results are certainly disappointing, but they are not unexpected. High inflation is hitting the business from both sides. Customers are spending less, and Amazon is paying more for its logistics business and data center operations as fuel and electricity have skyrocketed in price over the past year. But those headwinds don't change the long-term investment thesis. Amazon is still a key player in three quickly growing industries.\\n\\nIn e-commerce, Amazon operates the most-visited online marketplace, and it ranked as the second-largest digital retailer in the world last year as measured by gross merchandise value. That bodes well for the future. Retail e-commerce sales are expected to grow at almost 10% annually to reach $7.6 trillion by 2028, according to Grand View Research. But Amazon's most exciting opportunities lie in the higher-margin markets of cloud computing and digital advertising.\\n\\nOn that note, Amazon Web Services is the leader in cloud infrastructure, holding more market share than Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud combined. And cloud computing spend is expected to grow at 15.7% through the end of the decade, according to Grand View Research.\\n\\nFinally, Amazon is the fourth-largest digital advertiser in the world, but eMarketer says it nearly led the world in ad revenue growth last year. With that in mind, digital ad spend is expected to grow at 9.2% annually through the end of the decade, according to Precedence Research, but investors should expect Amazon to continue topping that trajectory.\\n\\nIn short, Amazon is set to grow revenue at a double-digit pace for years to come, which makes its current valuation of 2.1 times sales a reasonable price to pay. In fact, that multiple is much cheaper than the three-year average of 3.8 times sales. That's why this beaten-down growth stock is worth buying.\\n\\nShopify: The most popular e-commerce software platform\\n\\nShopify is the market leader in e-commerce software. That success stems from the broad scope of its simple yet powerful platform. With Shopify, retailers can grow their businesses across brick-and-mortar locations and a variety of digital channels, including direct-to-consumer websites, online marketplaces, and social media. Retailers can also access solutions for payment processing, financing, cross-border commerce, and money management, among others.\\n\\nThat robust offering has made Shopify a key player in e-commerce. In fact, it powered 10.3% of retail e-commerce sales in the U.S. last year, second only to Amazon.\\n\\nFinancially, Shopify has struggled as consumer demand has waned in response to high inflation. The company managed to beat Wall Street's estimates in the third quarter, but results were still somewhat disappointing. Revenue climbed 22% to $1.4 billion -- a deceleration from 46% growth in the same quarter last year -- and the company posted a non-GAAP loss of $0.02 per diluted share, down from a non-GAAP profit of $0.08 per diluted share.\\n\\nHowever, investors have good reason to believe Shopify will regain its momentum as inflation normalizes. The company has a long runway for growth. As mentioned earlier, retail e-commerce sales are expected to grow at almost 10% annually to reach $7.6 trillion by 2028, and management has outlined an ambitious strategy.\\n\\nMost notably, the company is building the Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) across the U.S., a network of warehouses, carriers, and delivery partners that will simplify all aspects of logistics: inbounding inventory from suppliers, distributing inventory to fulfillment centers, and shipping products to buyers. In doing so, the SFN will provide businesses with affordable access to one-day and two-delivery options, helping them provide a better experience for buyers. Management expects the project to reach scale in late 2023 or early 2024.\\n\\nOn that note, the SFN should also help Shopify with a second growth initiative: driving adoption of Shopify Plus, its platform for larger businesses. As part of its push upmarket, Shopify recently added AI-powered advertising software and business-to-business commerce (B2B) tools to its Plus platform. That greatly enhances Shopify's addressable market. According to Grand View Research, B2B e-commerce sales will grow at nearly 20% annually to reach $33.3 trillion by 2030.\\n\\nCurrently, shares trade at 8.7 times sales -- an absolute bargain compared to the three-year average of 36.3 times sales. That why this growth stock is a buy.\",\n",

Here, Nayampally reportedly “helped accelerate the adoption of Alexa Voice and other multimodal services into third-party devices”.\\n\\nHere’s some of what Brainchip CEO Sean Hehir had to say on recruiting Nayampally to the company:\\n\\nNandan has a deep technical understanding of semiconductor design and IP as well as the market factors that lead to product success… We look forward to leveraging his product experience and executive success at companies like Arm and Amazon to help us deliver BrainChip solutions to the market.\\n\\nNayampally added this:\\n\\nI am excited to join BrainChip. Our unique approach to performant and efficient edge AI at scale is a great enabler for an industry that is looking for innovative and transformative solutions… It is a great opportunity to not only advance product intelligence at the sensor and the edge but unleash the full power of AI. BrainChip is positioned to create that positive change and I’m thrilled to be a part of making that happen.\\n\\nBut it doesn’t seem like investors are too impressed by this announcement, judging by the performance of the Brainchip share price this Monday.\\n\\nBrainchip shares have copped a nasty beating over 2022.

People interacted only through the tech companies\\' products and services.\\n\\nNow the economy is slowing, and the game for the tech sector is changing -- but not in a good way. The industry is sharply hurt as the world\\'s central banks fight inflation, which is at its highest level for 40 years.\\n\\nAfter leaving interest rates at almost zero, the U.S. Federal Reserve has been increasing them since March to crush the high prices of goods and services, which have whacked consumers\\' purchasing power.\\n\\nMany economists and business leaders say this monetary policy is likely to cause a so-called hard landing in the economy, a recession. These fears are prompting companies to delay investment, while households postpone discretionary purchases -- such as tech gadgets.\\n\\nHigher Rates, Stronger Dollar\\n\\nThe higher rates has also helped the U.S. dollar strengthen against other currencies, which consequently eats into the revenue generated in international markets by tech companies when they convert foreign currencies into dollars.\\n\\nThe tech-sector landscape is, to put it mildly, bleak. And third-quarter-earnings\\' season, which is winding down, has confirmed this. Microsoft (MSFT) - Get Free Report, Alphabet (GOOGL) - Get Free Report, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Free Report, Meta Platforms (META) - Get Free Report and company have all warned of economic uncertainty.\\n\\nIn response, investors are liquidating tech stocks. Shares of Meta Platforms, parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have fallen 36% in the fourth quarter. Over the same period Amazon shares are down 23%, Alphabet is down 15% and Microsoft is off 11%.\\n\\nThis bearish movement may well continue as the sector has just delivered another round of bad news in the form of massive job cuts and hiring freezes.\\n\\nAmazon, the e-commerce giant founded by Jeff Bezos, on Nov. 2 said it would \"pause on new incremental hires in our corporate workforce.\"\\n\\n\"We anticipate keeping this pause in place for the next few months, and will continue to monitor what we’re seeing in the economy and the business to adjust as we think makes sense,\" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology, wrote in a message to employees.\\n\\n\"We’re facing an unusual macroeconomic environment, and want to balance our hiring and investments with being thoughtful about this economy. This is not the first time that we’ve faced uncertain and challenging economies in our past,\" she explained.\\n\\nTech Layoffs Are Continuing\\n\\nThe move is the latest wave of cost-cutting measures from the Seattle group in recent weeks. Amazon has already removed more than 10,000 job offers in its retail division and has stopped many projects. The firm has shut down its Treasure Truck Program, a fleet of roving vans that offers daily discounts on a bunch of items.\\n\\nJust a day later, online-payments giant Stripe said it would eliminate 14% of its staff this week.\\n\\n\"At the outset of the pandemic in 2020, the world rotated overnight towards e-commerce. We witnessed significantly higher growth rates over the course of 2020 and 2021 compared to what we had seen previously,\" Stripe CEO Patrick Collison wrote to employees.\\n\\n\"The world is now shifting again. We are facing stubborn inflation, energy shocks, higher interest rates, reduced investment budgets, and sparser startup funding,\" he continued. \"We think that 2022 represents the beginning of a different economic climate.\"\\n\\nOn the same day, ride-share company Lyft (LYFT) - Get Free Report also announced a cost-reduction plan, including the elimination of 13% of the workforce, or 683 employees.\\n\\n\"The announced reduction in force is a proactive step to ensure the company is set up to accelerate execution and deliver strong business results in Q4 of 2022 and in 2023,\" Lyft said in a regulatory filing.\\n\\nIn a memo to employees CEO Logan Green and President John Zimmer said: \"There are several challenges playing out across the economy.

       "  \"Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) surged higher by 10% following its second-quarter earnings report, but it might be the conditions of that gain that make the surge so notable. Amazon did not rise because of its earnings; it reported a quarterly loss and fell short of estimates on a key metric.\\n\\nHowever, successes in other areas made it easier for investors to overlook bad news. That changed perception could become a significant catalyst for Amazon stock as it works to recover from the bear market.\\n\\nAmazon's earnings\\n\\nOn the surface, Amazon's earnings seem uninspiring. Net sales of $121 billion beat estimates of $119 billion and grew 7% from year-ago levels. Nonetheless, net losses of $2 billion, or $0.20 per share, fell well short of the $0.13 net income that analysts had expected.\\n\\nAmazon posted losses primarily because its operating expenses rose 12%. Additionally, Amazon logged $6 billion in non-operating losses during Q2, which stands in contrast to $1 billion in non-operating income in the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nThe areas where it struggled most are its North America and international segments, the parts of the company driving the overwhelming majority of Amazon's revenue. Since operating expenses exceeded net sales in both segments, they reported a combined $2.4 billion in operating losses.\\n\\nHowever, Amazon continues to show strength in one key segment -- Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud division posted net sales of $19.7 billion, rising 33% compared with year-ago levels.\\n\\nMoreover, despite accounting for only 16% of company sales, it reported an operating income of $5.7 billion, a 36% increase year over year. This means that Amazon earned a total of $3.3 billion in operating income thanks to its cloud segment.\\n\\nAmazon also released a more positive Q3 net sales outlook. It forecasts quarterly net sales of $125 billion to $130 billion. This amounts to a 15% increase at the midpoint. Also, since analysts had forecast $126.4 billion in net sales, this could point to a slight increase if it hits the $127.5 billion midpoint.\\n\\nWhat the reaction may mean\\n\\nMore importantly, it shows that investors seem to now perceive Amazon as a conglomerate as opposed to just a retailer. This is a positive development since its net product sales fell over the previous 12 months. Also, AWS's operating income has become the one number that matters as it has long served as Amazon's primary earnings driver. In the case of Q2, AWS made up all of the company's positive operating income.\\n\\nMoreover, the company now publishes results for its advertising services, a non-retail business that can now attract more attention. In Q2, advertising made up almost $8.8 billion of its quarterly net sales. This was an 18% increase at a time when many ad-related stocks reported disappointing earnings.\\n\\nGiven these changes, its retail business performance might seem uninspiring. Indeed, retailing is a low-margin business that requires high fixed costs. Its North America and international retail segments reported operating margins of -0.5% and -4.6%, respectively, for the trailing 12 months, a sharp contrast to AWS's 31.1% margin.\\n\\nThe current struggles do not mean that investors should refer to Amazon's retail operations as loss leaders. These segments turned a profit in the past and will likely do so again. However, segments such as AWS and its advertising business will probably drive most of the profits and, by extension, the growth of Amazon stock.\\n\\nInvesting in Amazon\\n\\nInvestors' positive reaction to a mixed earnings report bodes well for Amazon stock. Despite a lackluster performance in e-retailing, Amazon shares rose as investors responded to the successes of its non-retail segments.\\n\\nE-commerce will probably continue to drive most of the company's revenue, and the company should remain a major force on the retail scene. But for stockholders, businesses such as AWS and advertising will likely serve as the main reasons to own this internet and direct-marketing retail stock.\",\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) were falling today, as the tech giant followed the market's lead and pulled back in response to a better-than-expected jobs report.\\n\\nThough strong jobs numbers may sound like good news, they make it more likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates and eventually induce a recession. Since Amazon is a cyclical business , driven by consumer spending on e-commerce and businesses spending on cloud infrastructure, the company is sensitive to the macroeconomic climate.\\n\\nAs a result, the stock finished the day down 4.8%, wiping approximately $60 billion off of its market cap. The Nasdaq also fell 3.8%.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nComing into the jobs report, Amazon had already been showing signs of weakness. Earlier this week, multiple news outlets reported that the company had implemented a hiring freeze in its corporate retail division, which will last at least through the end of the year. Amazon has also been closing warehouses and delaying plans to open new ones, and it made the surprising move of holding a second Prime Day next week, a sign it needs to move inventory before the holidays.\\n\\nThere was one minor piece of news out on Amazon today. The company is abandoning live tests of its home delivery robot, Scout, another sign of slowing growth and cost-cutting. However, that wouldn't have had enough of an impact to knock the stock down 5%.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAlso this week, Amazon announced that it's hiring 150,000 workers for the holiday season, a sign it's still expecting strong sales in the holiday season.\\n\\nHowever, investors should expect Amazon to remain sensitive to interest rates and the prospects of a recession. It's a growth stock, after all, and higher interest rates make future earnings less valuable, which has an outsize impact on growth stocks.\\n\\nIf the Federal Reserve continues to crank up interest rates, Amazon stock is likely to remain under pressure.\",\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN 0.80%) stock was pulling back today as a combination of reports that the company planned to make a bid for home healthcare specialist Signify Health (SGFY -0.17%) and a broader market sell-off on fears of rising interest rates weighed on the stock this morning.\\n\\nAs of 10:18 a.m. ET, Amazon stock was down 3.3%.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nOver the weekend, The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon was among the bidders angling to take over Signify Health, which said in early August that it was open to an acquisition. That news sent shares of Signify, which provides technology to help in-home care providers, up nearly 40%, but Amazon was moving in the opposite direction. The tech giant is up against CVS Health and UnitedHealth in what is shaping up to be a bidding war that could value the home healthcare company at more than $8 billion. Bids are due around Labor Day, according to the Journal.\\n\\nAmazon's interest in Signify comes just weeks after it acquired 1Life Healthcare, which operates the One Medical primary care practice, and its purchase of iRobot, best known for its Roomba robotic vacuum. Amazon has a long history of acquisitions, but a new takeover every few weeks could complicate the company's operations, as absorbing a separate company takes time and attention. New CEO Andy Jassy has been at the helm for only a year, and investors may be concerned that he'll dilute the company's strategy with too many acquisitions. Investors are also mindful that botched deals have felled past tech heavyweights.\\n\\nAdditionally, the stock seems to be down at least partly on broad market sentiment, as the Nasdaq was off 2% this morning. Among the concerns is a new survey showing it will take two years or longer for the Fed to bring inflation down to its 2% target, implying ongoing rate hikes and an increasing likelihood of a recession.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAmazon is big enough that it can afford to make a mistake with a pricey acquisition, but investors should keep an eye on the Signify takeover, as its market cap ballooned to $8.4 billion on the reports of Amazon's interest. That could make it the company's priciest acquisition to date after its $13.7 billion buyout of Whole Foods. Amazon also bought Hollywood studio MGM for $8.5 billion earlier this year.\\n\\nSignify is profitable, making it less risky than other deals, but the move is primarily a bet on Amazon's growth potential in the healthcare industry.\",\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) climbed higher Monday morning, adding as much as 3.1%. As of 1:29 p.m. ET, the stock was still up 1.5% -- even as each of the major stock indexes slumped.\\n\\nThe catalyst that sent the e-commerce giant higher were reports the company will hold a second Prime Day sale this year, which will kick off in just weeks.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nIn a press release that dropped early this morning, the company introduced Amazon\\'s Prime Early Access Sale, a shopping event exclusively for Prime members, which will be held on Oct. 11-12. \"The new 48-hour event gives Prime members exclusive early access to holiday deals,\" the company said in a statement. The sale will have items from popular brands, including Peloton and New Balance, while also offering the lowest prices of the year on a variety of other products.\\n\\nThe sale will be available in 15 countries -- including the U.S. -- \"giving members a chance to kick off the holiday shopping season early with hundreds of thousands of deals.\" As part of the event, Amazon is providing a Top 100 list, which will include \"the season\\'s most popular and giftable items.\"\\n\\nFurthermore, members will be provided with \"early access\" to check out the holiday gift guides and early deals beginning today. Initial promotions include a four-month free trial of Amazon Music Unlimited, a free one-year subscription to Just Eat Takeway.com\\'s Grubhub+, or a third-generation Echo Dot for $0.99.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nSince it was introduced in 2015 to celebrate the company\\'s 20th anniversary, Amazon Prime Day has become a customer-favorite event, spawning a multitude of copycats and imitators. While the company keeps details about the financial results of the event quiet, estimates suggest that Prime Day (which is now a two-day event) generated record sales of $12 billion in 2022. It\\'s important to view that in context, however, as it\\'s just a drop in the bucket compared to the $470 billion in revenue Amazon generated last year.\\n\\nStill, given the growing importance of its annual sale, it\\'s not too surprising that Amazon would double down on the event -- much to the delight of its shareholders.',\n",
       "  \"Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.Com Inc., during the GeekWire Summit in Seattle, Washington, U.S., on Tuesday, Oct. 5, 2021.\\n\\nThe stock closed at $2,177.18 on Tuesday, up just .06% from Monday. The last time Amazon traded around these prices was on Feb. 20, 2020, when the stock reached an intraday high of $2,176.79. That's before the name dipped in March 2020 along with the rest of the market during the initial pandemic uncertainty in the U.S. It's more than 40% off from the company's 52-week intraday high of $3,773.08, which it hit July 13, 2021.\\n\\nShares of Amazon have given up nearly all of their gains from the pandemic.\\n\\nThe company's stock skyrocketed in 2020 and 2021 as e-commerce boomed during the pandemic, with consumers flocking to online retailers for everything from face masks and Lysol wipes to patio furniture and dumbbells. Amazon and other digital retailers now face growing pressure to prove they can sustain the high-flying growth they enjoyed during the crisis, as the economy reopens and consumers head back to physical stores.\\n\\nAmazon's latest earnings report did little to ease those concerns. The company posted its slowest revenue growth since the dot-com bust and provided an outlook for the current quarter that fell short of Wall Street's estimates.\\n\\nShifting market conditions have added another challenge. Investors began to rotate out of tech stocks at the end of last year, spurred by rising inflation and the specter of higher interest rates. That trend accelerated this year, after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, causing oil prices to spike further. Stocks have sold off further in recent days after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe sell-off has hit the technology sector particularly hard, with tech giants losing more than $1 trillion in value between Thursday and Monday.\\n\\nWATCH: 'We like Big Tech stocks like Amazon and Apple right now,' says Needham's Laura Martin\",\n",
       "  'Other than Apple , it was a brutal earnings week for Big Tech.\\n\\nAlphabet , Amazon , Meta and Microsoft combined lost over $350 billion in market cap after offering concerning commentary for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Between slowing revenue growth — or declines in Meta\\'s case — and efforts to control costs, the tech giants have found themselves in an unfamiliar position after unbridled growth in the past decade.\\n\\nThird-quarter results this week came against the backdrop of soaring inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession. Apple bucked the trend after beating expectations for revenue and profit. The stock on Friday had its best day in over two years.\\n\\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum was Meta, which has seen its stock price collapse in 2022. Facebook\\'s parent came up short on earnings, recorded its lowest average revenue per user in two years and said sales in the fourth quarter will likely decline for a third straight period.\\n\\n\"There are a lot of things going on right now in the business and in the world, and so it\\'s hard to have a simple \\'We\\'re going to do this one thing, and that\\'s going to solve all the issues,\\'\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company\\'s earnings call on Wednesday.\\n\\nMeta\\'s stock had its worst week since the company\\'s IPO in 2012, plunging 24% over the past five days. Microsoft fell 2.6% for the week, due to a 7.7% decline on Wednesday after the company gave weak guidance for the year-end period and missed estimates for cloud revenue.\\n\\nThings were also bleak at Amazon, which dropped 13%. A gloomy fourth-quarter forecast along with a dramatic slowdown in its cloud-computing unit were largely to blame for the sell-off.\\n\\nWhile Amazon Web Services saw expansion slow to 27.5% from 33% in the prior period, Google\\'s cloud group, which is significantly smaller, sped up to almost 38% growth from around 36%. Google plans to keep spending in cloud even as it intends to rein in headcount overall growth in the next few quarters.\\n\\n\"We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption, and we continue to invest accordingly,\" Ruth Porat, Alphabet CFO, said on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. \"We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.\"\\n\\nHowever, results from the rest of Google parent Alphabet were less impressive. The company\\'s core advertising business grew just slightly, and YouTube\\'s ad revenue dropped from the prior year. The reverse was true for Amazon, which is playing catchup to Google and Facebook in digital advertising. In Amazon\\'s ad business, revenue growth accelerated to 30% from 21%, topping analysts\\' estimates.\\n\\n\"Advertisers are looking for effective advertising, and our advertising is at the point where consumers are ready to spend,\" said Brian Olsavsky, the company\\'s finance chief. \"We have a lot of advantages that we feel that will help both consumers and also our partners like sellers and advertisers.\"\\n\\nAnalyst Aaron Kessler at Raymond James lowered his price target on Amazon stock to $130 from $164 after the results. But he maintained his equivalent of a buy rating on the stock and said the company\\'s \"robust advertising growth\" has the potential to help Amazon fatten up its margin.\\n\\nAs investors continue to rotate away from tech, they\\'re finding money-making opportunities in other parts of the market that had previously lagged behind software and internet names. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3% this week, the fourth weekly gain in a row for the index. Prior to 2021, the Dow had underperformed the Nasdaq for five straight years.\\n\\nWATCH: Wall Street set to open in the red as investors digest disappointing tech earnings',\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon.com (AMZN 0.80%) climbed 2.7% on Friday after the e-commerce titan moved to bolster its robotics expertise.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon struck a deal to acquire Cloostermans. The Belgium-based company designs and manufactures cutting-edge technology that can be used to move items through warehouses more efficiently. The financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s relationship with Cloostermans began in 2019. The e-commerce giant uses Cloostermans\\' tools to move heavy pallets and totes through its warehouses. Now, Amazon wants to use the tech company\\'s engineering expertise to develop more advanced solutions, which it hopes will enhance its employees\\' productivity, reduce waste, and improve worker safety at its warehouses.\\n\\n\"As we continue to broaden and accelerate the robotics and technology we design, engineer and deploy across our operations, we look forward to welcoming Cloostermans to Amazon and are excited to see what we can build together,\" Amazon executive Ian Simpson said in a blog post.\\n\\nCloostermans\\' roughly 200 employees will join Amazon\\'s robotics team. Amazon purchased robot maker Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012. Since then, it has deployed over 500,000 robots across its global fulfillment network. That includes Proteus, Amazon\\'s first fully autonomous mobile robot, which began operating in its warehouses earlier this year.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAutomation is expected to be a key priority for Amazon in the coming years. A tight labor market is leading to wage inflation, which is taking a toll on the company\\'s profit margins. Robots could help to offset higher labor costs, thereby boosting Amazon\\'s profitability.',\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) rose 1.8% on Thursday, as excitement for the e-commerce juggernaut's Prime offerings grew among shoppers and investors alike.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon Prime offers members a host of benefits. For $14.99 per month or $139 per year, subscribers can get free two-day (and, increasingly, same-day) delivery on millions of items. They can also access thousands of shows on Prime Video and millions of songs on Amazon Music. Book rentals, gaming, photo storage, and a host of other services also add to Prime's value.\\n\\nNever one to rest on its laurels, Amazon constantly tries to make Prime even more alluring to consumers. On Tuesday, the company announced that Prime members could sign up for a free one-year membership to Grubhub+. The service, which is valued at $9.99 per month, offers unlimited no-cost delivery from thousands of restaurants across the country.\\n\\nInvestors were thrilled to see that the deal also gave Amazon warrants to purchase a 2% stake in Grubhub. That stake could increase to 15% if the partnership helps Grubhub achieve certain customer growth targets.\\n\\nAnd on Wednesday, Amazon announced an array of shopping deals for its upcoming Prime Day event. The shopping bonanza kicks off on July 12 and will feature sizable discounts on Amazon's devices and products from a wide range of third-party merchants.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAmazon's partnership with Grubhub could help it gain a stronger presence in the rapidly expanding food-delivery space. It could also help Amazon gain more Prime members, who tend to be the online retail giant's most profitable customers.\\n\\nAdditionally, a successful Prime Day event could help Amazon reduce some of the slack in its massive fulfillment network. The company is also reportedly planning to hold a second Prime shopping event later this year to further boost sales.\",\n",
       "  \"Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) isn't known for its hardware releases the way a company like Apple is, but the e-commerce giant has built an impressive array of devices over the years. Those include its Fire tablets, Fire smart-TV devices, Alexa gadgets, Kindle e-readers, and smart-home devices, like the Ring.\\n\\nOn Wednesday, Amazon hosted what may have been its biggest product-release event ever. It unveiled a new smart TV, a Kindle you can write on called the Scribe, four new Echo devices, an improved Ring camera, and new features for its Astro robot, among other announcements.\\n\\nThe news didn't seem to have much of an impact on Amazon's stock price Wednesday. Shares finished up 3.2%, though that seemed to owe more to the broad-market's gains in response to the Bank of England's moves to shore up the pound, rather than the product announcement itself.\\n\\nStill, investors shouldn't ignore the new product lineup. Even though gadgets aren't central to Amazon's business, they still fulfill an important function.\\n\\nWhat it does for Amazon\\n\\nAmazon's new-product announcement helps it accomplish two goals. First, it primes the consumer-spending pump for its second Prime Day in October and for the holiday season coming shortly after that.\\n\\nAmazon tends to focus on selling its own products during Prime Day and the holidays, and offers discounts in order to accelerate adoption. Adding new products just ahead of its sales holiday is a clever way to build excitement for the new devices.\\n\\nBut the e-commerce company is interested in more than just sales. Most of the products it sells encourage spending after the purchase and strengthen its consumer ecosystem, which is built around Amazon Prime. A purchase of a Fire Tablet, for example, makes it easier for a consumer to shop on Amazon and watch content on Amazon Prime Video. If someone purchases a Kindle e-reader, they then have to buy e-books from Amazon. Selling Echo devices helps Amazon improve its voice-activation technology and collect data.\\n\\nWhy hardware isn't crucial for Amazon\\n\\nTech hardware companies, such as Apple, get most of their revenue from sales of devices, like the iPhone and iPad. For Amazon, hardware only makes up a fraction of its sales. Most of its revenue comes from e-commerce, selling the wide range of products available on its website. Furthermore, most of the company's profit comes from its cloud-computing division and third-party marketplace. In fact, most of the company's e-commerce sales come from third-party sellers, rather than directly from Amazon.\\n\\nStill, the company has long sought to differentiate itself with its hardware and is the leader in categories like e-readers and voice-activated devices. Amazon's recent acquisition of iRobot also shows that it continues to see hardware as a growth market, though it's not clear yet what its strategy is with iRobot.\\n\\nIs Amazon stock a buy?\\n\\nThe wide-ranging product release shows that Amazon's ambitions in hardware haven't taken a back seat to its other initiatives, and the new products could give a boost to fourth-quarter revenue, especially with Prime Day 2 and the holiday season right around the corner. However, the best reason to buy Amazon stock isn't a new smart TV or an updated Ring device. It's that the stock is trading at a discount, just as the company's performance is about to improve.\\n\\nAmazon stock is down 37% from its all-time high, falling with the broad market sell-off on fears of a recession. In addition, the company's growth has slowed down due to difficult comparisons with results a year ago, especially in e-commerce.\\n\\nHowever, the good news is that Amazon's results should improve in the second half of the year. In its guidance for the third quarter, the company called for revenue growth between 13% and 17%, a significant improvement from 7% growth in Q2.\\n\\nThe fourth quarter, meanwhile, should be its most profitable of the year, as retail sales are seasonally strongest. This will leverage fixed costs in its warehouses, growing its profit margins. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services, its cloud-computing division, continues to deliver strong results, with revenue rising 33% to $19.7 billion. The operating margin for AWS clocked in at 29%, giving it $5.7 billion in operating income.\\n\\nIn other words, Amazon continues to grow briskly. The company also continues to innovate across multiple business lines. Its e-commerce profitability will improve as it moves past the recent headwinds in the sector, and AWS remains a juggernaut.\\n\\nIn that context, the current discount on Amazon stock looks like a mistake. Investors should take advantage and scoop up shares before its results improve.\",\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nAmazon\\'s (AMZN 0.80%) stock was falling today on seemingly no company-specific news. Instead, some investors may be pulling back from the stock today after its shares climbed nearly 10% last week, as they assess the risk of a potential economic slowdown.\\n\\nInvestors temporarily got excited about some stocks last week, pushing up the Nasdaq Composite by about 7.4%, but that excitement appears to have tapered off today. The e-commerce company was down 2.5% as of 2:29 p.m. ET Monday.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nInvestors have been generally very pessimistic about the market lately as inflation has climbed to its highest level in four decades. To bring sky-high inflation back down, the Federal Reserve has committed to hikes of the federal funds rate throughout 2022.\\n\\nAnd while those rate increases could very well help slow inflation, they could also slow the economy down too much, and potentially spur a recession.\\n\\nAmazon investors may have taken notice of an investor note by S&P Global today in which analysts from the firm estimated the risk of a recession next year to be at 40%.\\n\\n\"As we inch toward potential recession, we expect the Fed\\'s stronger action to slow hiring and raise unemployment. Under such a scenario, the \\'cure\\' for the U.S. economy and jobs market may feel worse than the disease,\" the S&P Global research note said.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAnalysts and banks hardly agree about whether or not there will be a recession in the next year, let alone the percentage of probability for one. But even so, investors are taking a very cautious approach to stocks right now, in case an economic slowdown is on the horizon.\\n\\nAmazon investors may be anticipating that if a slowdown does occur, it could hurt spending on the company\\'s e-commerce platform and also slow down the company\\'s lucrative cloud computing business.\\n\\nNo matter what happens, investors should anticipate more volatility in the market in the months ahead, but they should also remember that buying stocks in great companies and holding on to them for five years or longer is still the best way to earn significant gains in the market.',\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) have fallen hard in the first half of 2022 and are down 32% year to date, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Part of the drop is due to the broader stock market's tumble as investors processed news of rising inflation and interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nBut the biggest reason for Amazon's share price drop this year comes from the company's dismal first-quarter results, which were reported back in April. The e-commerce company reported its first quarterly loss since 2015 and issued disappointing guidance that sent its share price into a downward spiral.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon shocked analysts and investors when it reported a net loss of $3.8 billion in the quarter, its first quarterly loss in seven years and far below its net income of $8.1 billion in the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nThat loss came partly because of Amazon's investment in the electric vehicle (EV) maker Rivian Automotive. It owns about 18% of the EV company, and Amazon reported a pre-tax valuation loss of $7.6 billion related it its Rivian holdings in the quarter.\\n\\nBut Amazon's net loss also came as the company went on a hiring spree during the pandemic with e-commerce demand soaring. With tons of new workers and higher spending costs due to inflation, Amazon's expenses ballooned.\\n\\nInvestors were also disappointed with the guidance that management provided. The company said revenue for the second quarter would be in the range of $116 billion to $121 billion, lower than analysts' consensus average of $125.5 billion.\\n\\nInvestors will get a clearer picture of Amazon's finances when it reports second-quarter results, likely next month.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nIn the near term, Amazon investors could face some share price swings. Inflation is still stubbornly high and the company will continue to experience higher costs. And with the Federal Reserve focused on bringing inflation back down, more interest rate hikes are on the table, which could spook the market even more.\\n\\nBut over the long term, Amazon investors should keep in mind that the company is still a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. It is in a solid financial position and could end up being a great stock to have many years from now.\",\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) declined on Friday after FedEx (FDX 1.17%) reported a steep drop in profits amid a downturn in global shipping volumes. As of 2:25 p.m. ET, Amazon\\'s stock price was down roughly 3%.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nCOVID-19-related disruptions in Asia and conflict in Europe are denting demand for FedEx\\'s international shipping solutions. At the same time, the U.S. economy appears to be slowing.\\n\\n\"Global volumes declined as macroeconomic trends significantly worsened later in the quarter, both internationally and in the U.S.,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam said in a business update to investors.\\n\\nFedEx said it expects business conditions will \"further weaken\" in the coming months. In response to this projected downturn in shipping demand, the logistics giant is parking aircraft, cutting labor hours, and closing more than 90 FedEx Office locations.\\n\\nWorse still, Subramaniam said during an interview with CNBC\\'s Jim Cramer that the economy could soon enter a \"worldwide recession.\" \"We\\'re seeing that volume decline in every segment around the world,\" Subramaniam said.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nFedEx\\'s disappointing results and concerning forecast sent chills down the spines of investors. As one of the largest shipping and logistics companies in the world, FedEx has a bird\\'s-eye view of the global economy.\\n\\nAmazon, as one of the largest retailers and e-commerce companies in the U.S. and many international markets, could be particularly exposed to a global recession. Consumers already appear to be pulling back on discretionary spending as inflation takes a heavy toll on their budgets. These trends could worsen if FedEx\\'s grim view of global economic conditions proves accurate.',\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nMonster retailer Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) doesn\\'t often lose, so shareholders get discouraged when the company doesn\\'t come in first in a contest. That was the situation on Tuesday, when a rival\\'s bid was selected for a big healthcare asset that was in play. As a result, Amazon\\'s share price closed the day over 1% lower, a steeper fall than that of the S&P 500 index.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon was vying for healthcare services company Signify Health, but the nod ended up going to CVS Health, whose bid was worth roughly $8 billion. Other companies participating in the effort to acquire Signify were UnitedHealth Group and Option Care Health.\\n\\nAmong that crowd, Amazon was a bit of an outlier. UnitedHealth and Option Care are pure-play healthcare companies. Amazon, which has always aimed to be a retailer of any product or service imaginable, is still considered by many to be more of a giant online shopping outlet than a provider of healthcare services.\\n\\nIn Signify\\'s press release announcing its selection of CVS, CEO Kyle Armbrester said that \"we determined that CVS Health is the ideal partner, given its focus on expanding access to health services and helping consumers navigate to the best sites of care.\"\\n\\nWhile Amazon has indisputably made strides in its medical business efforts -- witness its $3.9 billion deal for primary care provider 1Life Healthcare earlier this year -- it still isn\\'t readily identified with that sector. It wouldn\\'t be surprising if this made the company a dark horse candidate, at best, in the Signify bidding.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAmazon isn\\'t known for setbacks and management probably isn\\'t too fond of them, so we can expect the company to make fresh bids for other healthcare businesses that come into play. But other entities with deep pockets will also be looking to buy, so Signify might not be the last of its defeats in the sector.',\n",
       "  'Amid mounting economic uncertainty this holiday season, nearly three-quarters of U.S. shoppers plan to spend less than or the same as last year, according to a new Goldman Sachs consumer survey. And Club holding Amazon (AMZN), a leading retailer for holiday sales and promotions, should be a top destination for American bargain-hunters. American consumers are being squeezed by persistent inflation, high interest rates and a broader economic slowdown, meaning many have less money in their pockets to shell out on gifts. Goldman Sachs expects total holiday retail sales to grow between 6% and 8% throughout November and December, compared with 13.5% growth during the same two-month period last year. That\\'s why many shoppers are likely to choose Amazon\\'s ecommerce platform for its regular deals, varied price points, extensive offerings and quick delivery times. Goldman\\'s analysis comes amid an uptick in consumer spending, with retail sales rising last month and inflation cooling , according to recent U.S. government data. At the same time, earnings at big U.S. discount retailers Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) this week showed Americans are prioritizing spending on staples like groceries over discretionary items like clothes. Goldman Sachs polled 1,000 U.S. consumers to gauge spending trends for holiday shopping this year. The survey results, released Friday, found 43% of respondents plan to spend less this season than last year, 23% expect to spend the same and 31% indicated they could spend more on holiday items than last year. Higher-income consumers are also likely to spend less this year, the survey found. \"To date, U.S. consumer spending has remained resilient despite inflationary challenges,\" Goldman analysts wrote in a note Friday. But macroeconomic pressures, along with a shift in spending from goods to services like dining out and travel, should compress holiday shopping and lead to slower ecommerce growth in the fourth quarter, the analysts said. Nonetheless, Amazon maintains \"the largest share of implied holiday purchasing with 33% of consumers planning to spend the most at Amazon,\" followed by Walmart. As consumers search for value, Goldman expects a \"highly promotional environment\" across online retail platforms, with consumers holding off opening their wallets until they find deals. Almost 30% of respondents surveyed by Goldman plan to complete most of their shopping during the annual Black Friday sales event on Nov. 26 — providing a \"healthy backdrop\" for Amazon, Walmart and Ross Stores (ROST), according to Goldman. Bottom line We agree with Goldman\\'s analysis that Amazon is one of the best-positioned players in the discount retail space to benefit from this year\\'s holiday shopping. Amazon has exhibited a flexibility to accommodate shifting shopping habits by offering deals like its Prime Early Access Sale event in October. We\\'ll be looking out for data on consumer trends this season to see how Amazon may be reaping the rewards. The company\\'s ability to effectively manage expenses is another swing factor we\\'ll be monitoring, as Amazon looks to restore its stock price, which has fallen more than 43% year-to-date.

       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) were trading down 1.8% at 11:35 a.m. ET on Friday after the company signed an agreement to acquire iRobot (IRBT -0.61%) for $1.7 billion. It's an all-cash transaction that comes to $61 per share for iRobot.\\n\\nWhile iRobot won't move the needle for the e-commerce giant's massive business operations spanning retail, cloud services, advertising, and other services, the combination should be a perfect match and plays to both companies' strengths.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon already sells iRobot products through its online store and integrates them with its Alexa voice assistant. The two companies share a passion for investing in innovative new products that bring immense value to consumers. In iRobot's case, that involves saving people time.\\n\\niRobot has struggled to grow its business while producing a high return on invested capital. But Amazon probably doesn't mind that. This acquisition fits Amazon's previous series of deals, most notably the maker of Ring doorbells.\\n\\nThe acquisition of iRobot fits a pattern of Amazon's long-term interest in expanding into smart home products to keep customers locked into its ecosystem.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nThe press release didn't specify a timeline for when the deal will be completed, but it did state that current iRobot CEO Colin Angle will remain in that role once the deal is final. That indicates Amazon plans to let iRobot continue doing what it's already doing, but most likely with an extra cash infusion.\\n\\niRobot is another nifty tech product Amazon can offer Prime members. It should fit in well with Amazon's current roster of previously acquired products, including Eero Wi-Fi routers. Perhaps Amazon will eventually launch new services and exclusive deals for Prime customers interested in trying robotic vacuums -- something that would not have been economically feasible for iRobot to offer before.\",\n",
       "  'What happened\\n\\nOn one of the better days for the stock market in recent times, Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) was a standout. On a general resurgence in tech stocks and a very positive new analyst note, the giant online retailer\\'s stock zoomed more than 5% higher on Wednesday, easily topping the 1.5% gain of the bellwether S&P 500 index.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nThe tech rally was certainly a tailwind for Amazon at the end of the day, but investors were probably more encouraged by that research note. It was written by JPMorgan Chase analyst Doug Anmuth, who shared a very heartening update on the company\\'s Prime loyalty program.\\n\\nFollowing what he calls a \"deep dive\" into Prime\\'s present and future, Anmuth came up with a new estimate of the program\\'s value to its subscribers. All told, according to his calculations, Prime membership confers roughly $1,100 in annual benefits, such as free shipping and savings on items like drug prescriptions. This makes it quite the compelling value proposition even at the recently increased rate of $139 per year.\\n\\nIt also makes it an increasingly more attractive add-on for Amazon customers. Again according to his estimates, Anmuth says those yearly benefits totaled around $1,000 in 2020, and only approximately $544 in 2016.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nNot surprisingly, the prognosticator is very bullish on Amazon stock. With his new take, he\\'s maintaining his overweight (buy) recommendation on it, at a price target of $200 per share. This level is nearly double that of the stock\\'s most recent closing price, even after Wednesday\\'s pop.',\n",
       "  \"Motley Fool contributor Will Ebiefung has outlined the pros and cons of purchasing some AMZN in September. Here, we’ll lay out his thesis and our own take on the matter.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool’s Will Ebiefung recently published his bullish take on Amazon stock. The expert acknowledges the company’s struggles amid both external and internal post-pandemic headwinds. Still, Mr. Ebiefung believes the e-commerce behemoth is poised for long-term growth.\\n\\nThe author’s perspective meshes well with the Amazon Maven’s long-term thesis for Amazon. However, though we might agree on the what, we do have somewhat different views on the how. Here’s a quick comparison of our theses.\\n\\nFigure 1: Is Amazon Stock a Buy? Here’s What One Expert Has to Say Amazon\\n\\n(Read more from Amazon Maven: Should Amazon (AMZN) Investors Be Worried About FedEx's Warning?)\\n\\nSolid growth drivers beyond e-commerce\\n\\nThis is where we find the most common ground with Ebiefung. Despite AMZN’s bottom line losses in the last two quarters, Amazon bulls argue that Bezos has paved the way to long-term success by carefully developing a full-fledged Amazon ecosystem.\\n\\nAWS has boasted double-digit growth since at least 2017 and has 30% operating margins. The company’s cloud arm has been at the center of many Amazon bulls’ theses; its profitability has been able to compensate for losses across the company’s other segments, including e-commerce.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Prime membership continues to deliver outsized benefits to consumers: According to JP Morgan’s Doug Anmuth, the package of benefits delivered by Amazon Prime Is worth roughly eight times the $139 annual cost. On a related note, Amazon’s rapid expansion into media production, coupled with its massive resource base, could allow it to crush streaming competition - such as Netflix - in the long run.\\n\\nLet’s also not forget Amazon’s ad business, which has been delivering outstanding revenue growth. In fact, Amazon’s ad revenue just recently surpassed YouTube’s.\\n\\nHow E-commerce Will Perform\\n\\nThe major difference between Ebiefung’s and the Amazon Maven’s perspectives comes down to Amazon’s e-commerce future. Amazon has suffered from macroeconomic pressures - including disrupted supply chains and increased costs - since the beginning of the pandemic.\\n\\nMr. Ebiefung believes Amazon’s plans to explore new markets, such as Africa and Latin America, could help the company compensate for its top-line deceleration. The Amazon Maven is not as optimistic though. And the reason is the e-commerce industry’s very nature.\\n\\nSince profit margins per product sold are highly constricted, online retailing requires buying and selling at scale. But establishing and growing the required infrastructure across new continents would be highly costly.\\n\\nWe don’t see long-term returns matching others’ rosy expectations. Latin America’s e-commerce industry was worth $85 billion in 2020. Africa’s was only half of that; it’s projected to reach $43 billion by the end of 2022. By comparison, US e-commerce was worth $768 billion in 2021 and is projected to reach $1.3 trillion by 2025.\\n\\nEmerging markets, then, seem like the proverbial drop in the bucket. We don’t see a solid return on investment for Amazon’s efforts there.\\n\\nAWS, Not E-commerce, Is Key\\n\\nExpanding into new, potentially expensive markets is not the answer to Amazon’s top-line growth problems. We see such moves leading to fruitless infrastructure investments.\\n\\nAny revenue growth would come at the expense of depleting Amazon’s cash flows. This makes sense when the objective is to make expansions within the larger, more profitable US online retail market. But it doesn’t seem reasonable when it comes to Latin America’s or Africa’s much smaller e-commerce industries.\\n\\nAmazon already has some modest operations in Latin America and in Africa. But much profitability have we seen from Amazon’s International Segment? Not much.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Amazon has plenty of other growth drivers, with AWS being the flagship segment, as it were. Mr. Ebiefung himself points out that AWS added new big-ticket clients recently, including Delta Air Lines, Riot Games, and Jeffries Investment Bank. As a result of new client acquisitions, AMZN’s cloud arm operating income surged 36% in the second quarter. That gain helped to offset losses across the comapny’s e-commerce segments.\\n\\nIn my opinion, the number one reason to invest in Amazon remains AWS’ colossal growth rates. I believe investors should focus primarily on the cloud arm’s growth drivers.\\n\\nThat being said, they should also watch out for large and risky investments made within this space; any hit to Amazon’s “cash cow” could be devastating to the company’s overall profitability.\\n\\nLand a Top Equity Research Job with Peak Frameworks\\n\\nEquity research is a great career path that combines deep industry analysis and financial modeling, while exposing you to the strategic frameworks of many different types of investors in the stock market.\\n\\nMany students have used the Peak Frameworks Equity Research course to break into the industry out of school, or to transition into the field from a non-finance career path.

       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShares of Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) were up 27.1% in July, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. This handily beat the 9.1% return for the S&P 500. It seems investors celebrated strength in the titan's e-commerce operations. However, in my opinion, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was once again the main star of the show.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon stock only slightly outperformed the S&P 500 for most of the month. It wasn't until July 28 when it reported financial results for the second quarter of 2022 that Amazon stock decisively pulled ahead.\\n\\nOn July 14, Amazon announced it had its biggest Prime Day event ever. The two-day sales event for members sold an impressive 300 million items. It's a testament to Amazon Prime's ongoing strength. And Amazon stock performed well following this announcement.\\n\\nWhile e-commerce is an important part of Amazon's story, it's not the most exciting part of the business. Both Amazon's North America and international segments recorded operating losses in Q2, of $627 million and $1.77 billion respectively. The rising cost of infrastructure and logistics contributed to these operating losses.\\n\\nHowever, thanks to AWS, Amazon still had positive operating income in Q2. By itself, the cloud-computing service had operating income of $5.7 billion. The segment also enjoyed terrific revenue growth, up 33% year over year to $19.7 billion.\\n\\nMoreover, AWS's growth story isn't over. Amazon is constantly announcing new products, features, and availability for its profit driver. For example, on July 12, the company announced new capabilities for serverless analytics -- something that could be extremely valuable for companies dealing with outsize datasets.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAmazon has a market capitalization of nearly $1.4 trillion as of this writing. And the challenge for a company this size is meaningful growth. But it's clear that management has ideas.\\n\\nOn July 6, Just Eat Takeaway.com announced that it had partnered with Amazon to make Grubhub+ free for one year for Amazon Prime members. Just Eat Takeaway.com gets a substantial potential boost to its membership and the companies have the option of extending the deal every year. But for Amazon, its Prime members get free deliveries on food from Grubhub+ -- a perk that might help it grow its membership base even more.\\n\\nOf course, the bigger growth possibility came on July 21 when Amazon announced it was acquiring healthcare company 1Life Healthcare, often called One Medical, for $3.9 billion. This isn't the first time Amazon has flirted with the healthcare space. One Medical is a primary care company that allows both in-office appointments and telehealth services, which could be where the healthcare industry is going.\\n\\nAmazon certainly has the resources to make this large acquisition of One Medical. It only costs around 11% of Amazon's cash on its balance sheet. However, only time will tell if this will be a fruitful acquisition.\\n\\nOne thing's for sure: Even if Amazon struggles to make its way in the multitrillion-dollar global healthcare space, it will relentlessly keep searching for growth any way it can.\",\n",
       "  'The e-commerce juggernaut has been slowly recovering its share value after seeing sizable losses throughout the year. Is September the best time to hop on the AMZN bandwagon?\\n\\nLike practically all investors, Amazon (AMZN) - Get Free Report shareholders have experienced the market’s violent ups and downs in recent years. The e-commerce behemoth\\'s stock skyrocketed in 2020, stayed flat in 2021 (tanking both the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite), and plunged in the first half of 2022.\\n\\nBut there\\'s good news: Amazon\\'s stock does seem promising right now. The market is hopeful the company will announce double-digit growth in its third-quarter earnings report.\\n\\nHowever, as the past two years have taught us, holding AMZN isn\\'t always a peaceful ride into the sunset. It\\'s more like a roller coaster.\\n\\nFigure 1: Amazon Stock: Should You Buy It in September 2022? Getty\\n\\n(Read more from the Amazon Maven: Amazon\\'s Acquisition Spree: 3 Sectors the Company Could be Aiming For)\\n\\nAmazon\\'s Most Recent Quarter\\n\\nIn the second quarter, Amazon delivered surprisingly positive results. The company beat the market’s revenue expectations for the quarter by $2 billion, reaching $121 billion in sales.\\n\\nBack then, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was the star of the show. The cloud-computing business generated nearly $20 billion in revenue, of which $5.7 billion was operating profit.\\n\\nThe AWS segment appears to be headwind-proof, as it’s been keeping its double-digit growth record intact even throughout 2022. AWS grew 37% and 33% in the first and second quarters, respectively.\\n\\nOn the other hand, e-commerce is a mystery. The macroeconomic scenario has made the market bearish about the future of online retail.\\n\\nBut some opinions might have changed after Amazon reported record sales during its Prime Day and that its North America segment had produced 10% growth.\\n\\nCould the e-commerce industry be accelerating again?\\n\\nPlans for the Long-Term\\n\\nI believe Amazon is the kind of stock that suits investors looking for a long-term commitment, rather than a quick relationship. The company has been depleting its free cash flow in order to make sizable acquisitions.\\n\\nWithin less than a month, Amazon announced it will add to its portfolio both One Medical (ONEM) - Get Free Report and iRobot (IRBT) - Get Free Report. Amazon expects to spend $5.6 billion on both deals.\\n\\nAmazon\\'s cash-flow sacrifice indicates that management has a long-term vision for the company. Once the company leaders are able to deliver on their visions (e.g., enhancing Amazon’s presence in the healthcare industry), Amazon\\'s shares could start soaring soon.\\n\\nWhat Are the Risks of Investing in Amazon?\\n\\nWe must acknowledge that Amazon\\'s stock — like the entire equity market — is a risky investment. It\\'s important to understand that macroeconomic headwinds such as inflation, supply-chain constraints, and oil-supply shortages might not die down until the end of 2022.\\n\\nThat said, AMZN appears poised to thrive once these dark days are over.\\n\\nIn fact, Wall Street is considerably bullish on the stock. Of the 31 experts covering it on TipRanks, 30 have a \"buy\" recommendation. (The one left rates it as a “hold.”) And Amazon’s average price target is $175, implying 36% upside.\\n\\nExplore More Data And Graphs\\n\\nMany of the graphs used by the Amazon Maven are provided by Stock Rover.

       "  \"In this video, I will be talking about Amazon's (AMZN 0.80%) big move that was reported last week when management discussed ditching Amazon Basics, its first-party product offering.

       "  'Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on July 28, beating multiple forecasts set by Wall Street. The company\\'s shares soared 24% from July 26 to Aug. 18 as bullish investors put their faith in it.\\n\\nHowever, Amazon\\'s stock still has room for growth, with two of its recent acquisitions looking especially promising.\\n\\nGenius reason No. 1:\\n\\nAmazon went on an acquisition spree between July and August, with its first purchase being subscription-based healthcare company 1Life Healthcare (ONEM 0.84%), known as One Medical, for approximately $3.9 billion. The buyout will see Amazon venture into healthcare, an industry the company has been eyeing for some time. The acquisition might be a match made in heaven, considering One Medical\\'s mission and Amazon\\'s unique resources, which will undoubtedly boost the company.\\n\\nAs described in Amazon\\'s press release on the acquisition, \"One Medical combines in-person care in inviting offices across the country with digital health and virtual care services.\" Telehealth services soared in popularity throughout the worst of the pandemic, with virtual healthcare company Teladoc Health\\'s stock seeing a significant rise. However, the health stock\\'s nosedive of 65.4% year to date could be Amazon\\'s gain.\\n\\nIf the purchase is successful, Amazon will take control of One Medical\\'s almost 200 locations and roughly 770,000 patients nationwide -- a significantly larger reach than Teladoc. Additionally, Amazon has the chance to incorporate its own technologies, such as unmatched delivery infrastructure and an established subscription service with over 200 million members worldwide. Breaking into the healthcare industry might not come easy, but it seems that Amazon is more than capable of succeeding in its health endeavors.\\n\\nGenius reason No. 2:\\n\\nOn Aug. 5, Amazon announced plans to acquire consumer robotics company iRobot (IRBT -0.61%), the result of a deal valued at approximately $1.7 billion. Compared to One Medical, the purchase is arguably less risky and fits nicely into the company\\'s current product lineup.\\n\\nAmazon has gradually pushed into the smart-home industry over the years with its line of Alexa-enabled products, such as smart speakers, alarm clocks, thermostats, and security cameras. In addition to iRobot\\'s incredibly popular robot vacuums, Amazon\\'s purchase of the company also brings on its team of consumer robotic experts who have the potential to boost the company\\'s range of smart products as a whole and strengthen its hold on the growing industry.\\n\\nMoreover, Amazon has turned Alexa into a multibillion-dollar business through its smart devices and app store, called Alexa Skills. Developers have flocked to create various Alexa Skills, from which Amazon keeps 30% of the profits. In 2019, analysts estimated Amazon generates $2 billion a year from Alexa skills, with the company keeping $600 million. The acquisition of iRobot only increases the variety of smart products and Alexa Skills the company could offer, which could pay off in a big way for Amazon.\\n\\nAn opportunity for investors\\n\\nAlthough Amazon\\'s stock has soared since July, it still remains down at least 24% since the height it reached in November 2021. In addition to its recent acquisitions, the company has several promising opportunities on the horizon that should excite investors. Amazon\\'s advertising endeavors have proven especially fruitful for the company as the segment has generated $33.9 billion of revenue over the last four quarters, and the company is getting ready to dive deeper into the industry.\\n\\nAmazon has some exciting developments coming to its streaming service Prime Video in September, such as exclusively broadcasting NFL\\'s Thursday Night Football and the premiere of its highly anticipated Lord of the Rings series, The Rings of Power. Both content additions have the potential to pull in millions of viewers, while Thursday Night Football can also further the company\\'s already successful advertising endeavors.\\n\\nAmazon has a bright future ahead, and investors should be bullish about its stock as its promising outlook makes it an excellent long-term buy.',\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nAmazon (AMZN 0.80%) shareholders lost ground to the market on Thursday as the stock fell 3% by 3:30 p.m. ET, compared to a 1% drop in the S&P 500. The drop pushed the e-commerce giant below the market's return so far in 2022, down 11% since early January.\\n\\nIt came as investors brace for a potentially downbeat earnings report ahead in the next week.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nAmazon made a few announcements before the market opened today, including news that it is expanding its Prime shopping service to third-party retailers. The move might help the company attract more sellers as competition heats up with rivals like eBay, Walmart, and Shopify.\\n\\nYet the main factor likely driving the stock lower is worries about its upcoming earnings report. Amazon is set to announce first-quarter results on April 28. The company has announced three consecutive quarters of slowing sales gains, and most investors are expecting another slowdown for the early 2022 period.\\n\\nThat slowdown, coupled with increased spending on its distribution network and cloud infrastructure, might spell weaker earnings results ahead through at least this year.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nSome investors see a bright future ahead for the tech giant, though, as it boosts earnings on the cloud-services business and generates higher profits from a rising Prime subscription membership price. Yet those positive factors might not be obvious in Amazon's earnings report next Thursday.\\n\\nIn any case, the stock will likely remain volatile as investors digest the flood of fresh data as earnings season ramps up over the next week or so. And since the pandemic accelerated its growth so much in 2020 and 2021, it should be no surprise to investors if the business faces a period of relatively weaker earnings as it invests in building up its infrastructure.\",\n",
       "  \"What happened\\n\\nShareholders in Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) beat a rising market on Friday morning, with shares gaining 3% by 10:45 a.m. ET compared to a 1.4% boost in the S&P 500. The increase erased just a small portion of recent losses for the e-commerce giant's stock, though, which remains down roughly 30% so far in 2022\\n\\nThe rally was powered by a brightening outlook around economic growth and consumer spending.\\n\\nSo what\\n\\nA major factor driving Amazon's stock higher on Friday was the boost in the wider tech world. Many e-commerce and tech peers, including Shopify and Etsy, were trading higher through the early morning hours. Amazon and these peers have all fallen by more than the market so far in 2022, but there are indications that consumer spending is holding up well as we head into the summer season.\\n\\nSpecifically, retailers including Macy's and Ulta Beauty announced solid sales, customer traffic, and earnings results in the past day. These reports contrasted with earlier updates from companies like Walmart and Target that appeared to show a bigger negative impact from inflation on shopping trends.\\n\\nAmazon's business is dependent on economic growth to keep product sales rising, even though its cloud business is becoming a bigger factor.\\n\\nNow what\\n\\nAmazon shareholders should continue to see elevated volatility through updates that reflect whether the U.S. economy is approaching a recession. But the true returns from holding the tech stock will be driven by fundamental trends like the continuing shift toward e-commerce spending and the digital transformation that's driving more enterprises into cloud services.\\n\\nAs a leader in both of these growth spaces, Amazon is well positioned to capitalize on them, even if earnings are pressured over the next few quarters by slowing -- or negative -- economic growth.\",\n",
       "  \"Amazon's (AMZN 0.80%) stock has recently experienced volatile moves. Understandably, investors might wonder if it's an excellent time to buy the stock. I will answer that question using my six-step framework for analysis in this video.\\n\\nStock prices used were the afternoon prices of Sept. 5, 2022. The video was published on Sept. 5, 2022.\",\n",
       "  'Amazon (AMZN 0.80%) is no stranger to antitrust lawsuits. Just the other day, California filed a suit against Amazon alleging anticompetitive pricing policies. This filing isn\\'t the first time these allegations have come up, and it likely won\\'t be the last.\\n\\nBecause of the current environment, it\\'s not a far-fetched idea that Amazon could be split up voluntarily or by the government. It\\'s a worthwhile exercise to value each business segment of the company separately for two reasons. First, it could prepare investors for a split. Second, it also serves as a method to value the company and determine if it\\'s worth an investment today.\\n\\nLet\\'s see how each segment is valued and if Amazon is worth your investment dollars.\\n\\nA large business with multiple segments\\n\\nAmazon\\'s business can be split into two main segments: commerce and cloud computing. Commerce is much broader than the website you order items from. It also includes advertising, third-party seller services, and subscription products. Cloud computing, better known as Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides the infrastructure to process workloads through the cloud.\\n\\nThe commerce segment also generates the bulk of Amazon\\'s revenue. Over the past 12 months, the company brought in $485.9 billion in sales overall, and 85% of that came from commerce. However, that segment hasn\\'t made any money over the past year. It lost $7.1 billion; whereas, AWS made $22.4 billion in operating income.\\n\\nThose figures group all of the many commerce segments together. Amazon doesn\\'t break out its expenses for each segment, but it does break out its sales.\\n\\nSegment Q2 Net Sales Q2 YOY Growth Share of Total Revenue Online stores $50.9 Billion 0% 42% Physical stores $4.7 Billion 13% 4% Third-party seller services $27.4 Billion 13% 23% Subscription services $8.7 Billion 14% 7% Advertising services $8.8 Billion 21% 7% Amazon Web Services (AWS) $19.7 Billion 33% 16% Other $1.1 Billion 135% 1%\\n\\nThis table provides valuable insights. First, its online-store segment didn\\'t grow its sales but is still the largest. Second, AWS is the fastest-growing segment (the \"other\" segment is volatile, so growth likely isn\\'t sustainable) and the second largest. Lastly, advertising services still grew 21% year over year during a difficult ad environment.\\n\\nOverall, Amazon\\'s quarter was strong; it was just dragged down by its largest segment having difficult comparisons, because 2021\\'s second quarter was still during the height of COVID-19. But should the company need to be split, it\\'s challenging to determine which segments would go where.\\n\\nAWS would likely need to be its own entity because it is unrelated to commerce. Advertising could be seen as a conflict of interest, as it should theoretically be a neutral marketplace. One seller could pay Amazon to place its product above other similar ones, even if it is lower rated or more expensive. The rest of the divisions -- online stores, physical stores, third-party services, and subscriptions -- could remain a separate company.\\n\\nThat leaves three separate businesses: cloud computing, advertising, and commerce. Now it\\'s time to determine what each business is worth.\\n\\nValuation by parts\\n\\nTo determine what each entity is worth, I\\'ll apply a valuation comparable to companies that perform services similar to the newly formed Amazon businesses. While this approach has flaws, it\\'s a good way to estimate a valuation for each business.\\n\\nFirst, investors could compare the commerce business to retail giants like Target or Walmart. These two trade for 0.7 and 0.6 times sales, respectively. While these two companies have a more expansive physical footprint, Amazon has to pay for delivery. However, unlike Amazon\\'s commerce business, Walmart and Target are consistently profitable. Because of this, I will apply a valuation of 0.5 times sales to Amazon\\'s commerce business.\\n\\nFor advertising, The Trade Desk is a similar business. Its ad-tech platform connects buyers to sellers to ensure advertisers get the best results. Amazon\\'s platform has similar capabilities but also deals directly with ads, unlike The Trade Desk. Because of this, I\\'m going to discount this business significantly. The Trade Desk is valued at 22 times sales, but I\\'m going to cut that in half for Amazon\\'s ad business to 11 times sales.\\n\\nLastly, AWS is likely the most valuable. It\\'s growing quickly and is highly profitable. Its two main competitors, Microsoft\\'s Azure and Alphabet\\'s Google Cloud, aren\\'t stand-alone companies, so a valuation can\\'t be deduced from them.\\n\\nThere aren\\'t many businesses like it, but Adobe comes close. The product isn\\'t close to AWS, but its subscription revenue stream and high operating margins (35%) are similar to AWS. Adobe trades at 8.5 times sales, which is influenced by recent acquisition news. Before then, it traded at 11 times sales. I\\'ll apply a valuation of 13 times sales to AWS to adjust for this drop and account for AWS\\' faster sales growth.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s see the value of all three businesses.\\n\\nBusiness TTM Revenue P/S Valuation Business Valuation Commerce $379.9 Billion 0.5 $189.9 Billion Advertising $33.9 Billion 11 $372.9 Billion AWS $72.0 Billion 13 $936.0 Billion\\n\\nNow, let\\'s add up those three segments. Using this method, Amazon\\'s entire business is worth $1.5 trillion. However, its current market cap is $1.26 trillion. That means, according to my valuation method, the company\\'s stock is currently undervalued by 19%.\\n\\nSo, if Amazon gets broken up by regulators or through its own decision, investors will likely make a quick profit through a split. But that action might not happen.\\n\\nOne thing that is certain is that investors can purchase Amazon\\'s stock today. With its recent price movement, it looks undervalued, and investors should consider establishing a position and holding it for an extended period, even if it gets broken up.'],\n",
